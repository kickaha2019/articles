	"Swallows and Amazons" (1930) is the first book in the much-loved series by
	Arthur Ransome.  The book is set in the Lake District, and covers the
	adventures of the Walker children as they set up camp during the summer
	holidays on an island on the lake.  They become acquainted with the Blackett
	girls who live locally, and also with the girls' uncle.

	I have read and re-read the books from a young age, initially my mother's
	copies which were green-bound and dating from wartime.  The books made a
	deep impression on me, the poems and shanties they quote are how I know
	certain poems (like Stout Cortez looking out from a Peak in Darien.)  They
	are books I wish I could live in, to share the memorable stories that the
	children live.

	Not a lot happens in the books really.  But what does happen is turned into
	the enchanting and adventurous, particularly by Nancy Blackett who plays
	a pivotal role in many of the books.  Ransome's stories reawaken the sleeping
	child in me, reawaken the ability to find wonder in the small things.  
	A lot happens in the books really.  There are friendships and distrust and
	misunderstandings and disappointments and reconciliations and rejoicings.

	Arthur Ransome had practical experience of the sailing and camping in the
	book and this shows in the vivid descriptions of what the children do.  
	"Swallows and Amazons" is both a story of adventure and also a handbook 
	on how to sail, how to camp, how to have adventure.  The level of detail
	makes the books really come alive, really become real to the reader.  And so
	every so often I reread them - and just wish I could have a holiday with
	John, Susan, Titty, Roger, Nancy, and Peggy.
