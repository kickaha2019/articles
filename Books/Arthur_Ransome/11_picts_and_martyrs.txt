 The Picts and the Martyrs

Text:
	"The Picts and the Martyrs" (1943) is the eleventh book in the much-loved 
	"Swallows and Amazons" series by
	Arthur Ransome.  This book like the first is set in the Lake District, 
	but unlike most of the books does not have the Walker family in it.
	Instead Dot and Dick Callum arrive to stay in Beckfoot with the Blacketts,
	only to be not welcome at all when a stern Great Aunt decides Beckfoot
	needs her to look after it.  So Nancy turns them into Picts living
	in hiding, while she and Peggy suffer nobly.

	This is one of those great books in which nothing happens, yet
	everything happens.  Dot and Dick live the life of outlaws from a
	Walter Scott novel.  Through their eyes we discover how to catch trout
	bare-handed.  There are near escapes such as Dick having to hide in
	the armadillo box, or Nancy coming back from a night visit to the
	Callums.  Every page is full of real detail about mining and the fells
	and sailing and skinning rabbits and life back then.  It also is
	a refreshing refreshingly wholesome
	adventure, to put a sense of wonder back into the mundane.  
	Reading this book is the next best thing to actually being inside its
	pages.

	This is also one of the influences on the thoughts in my head.  From
	this book I was infected with an interest in Picts and tribes and
	their history.  Nancy has made a scarab flag for the Callums and that
	too pushed me towards Ancient Egypt and hieroglyphics and strange
	languages.  There's even a precursor to my love of Adventure games
	in the contrivances Nancy uses to communicate like mowing messages
	on a lawn, or hiding messages in an arrow as she did in "Swallowdale".
	
	This book also is an amusing story illustrating what happens when
	even for the right reasons we try to deceive.  As in a farce things
	just keep getting more complicated.  The game is almost up right at
	the end . . . but that would be telling.
