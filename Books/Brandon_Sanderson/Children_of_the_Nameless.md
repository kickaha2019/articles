[Children of the Nameless](https://brandonsanderson.com/a-christmas-present/) (2018)
follows a young girl Tacenda who is the only survivor after
a mysterious Lord destroys her village by summoning ghosts.
She sets off to the Lord's manor to kill him even though
she knows it will mean suicide. But surprises and twists and
turns await.

A very readable magical tale, a true page turner written by
a skilful writer of fantasy fiction. As through the story we
explore the setting, we also explore the characters, what
makes them tick.

Brandon Sanderson wrote this story for Wizards of the Coast, the
people behind [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en).
The story is available
for free, and the author wrote it for free (he's a fan of the
card game). A real Christmas present!
