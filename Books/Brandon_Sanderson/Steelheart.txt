 Steelheart

Text:
	[Steelheart] (2014)
	follows young David Charleston as he seeks revenge for his father's death.
	He has the slight problem his father was killed by an invincible
	super-powerful villain who's turned Chicago into steel.

	To some extent this could have been done as anime. The world of the book is
	one where ordinary people have gained unusual powers, a much-used
	device at the moment. ''Steelheart'' and its sequels deepen the
	experience by first exploring the powers of the Epics (those with
	the powers) - and their weaknesses. There is real world-building
	and magic system building here.

	There is also exploration of what power does to people. If you had
	power like ''Steelheart'' does could you stay sane? All power corrupts,
	absolute power corrupts absolutely as the man said. And can
	an Epic be redeemed? This theme runs through the series.

	Ignoring all that I'd just like to say this book is a well-written imaginative romp
	where the underdog humans take on super-villains.
