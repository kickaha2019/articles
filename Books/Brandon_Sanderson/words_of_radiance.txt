	[Words of Radiance] (2014)
	is the second book in Brandon Sanderson's ''Stormlight Archive'' series.
	It's a chunky read, well constructed with multiple characters and
	relevant interludes, and strong characters who are growing and
	developing.

	I liked how powerfully and promisingly the first book (''The Way of Kings'') finished, and
	the second book does even better. It is fantasy SF, but with a designed
	magical system that combines both magic and mechanics.

	Classical and classic fantasy.
