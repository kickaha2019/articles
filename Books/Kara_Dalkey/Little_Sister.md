*Little Sister* (1998) is the story of Mitsuko, the little sister
of the title.  Raised in court seclusion she comes up against
the cruel grime of the real world on a trip.  Her brother-in-law is
murdered by bandits, and her elder sister left demented.  To restore
her sister's soul Mitsuko goes on a strange odyssey into a world
of Japanese spirits and demons.

Kara Dalkey has set her book somewhere refreshingly different,
and introduces us to the Japan of the 1200s (perhaps I should say
a Japan of the 1200s.)  We learn naturally about tengus and
Gods, and enter a little into how people in the late Heian thought.
The story in *Little Sister* is not merely set against a feudal
Japanese backdrop, its logic is appropriate too.  Too many times
authors just borrow period words and dress and furnishing but
still write contemporary fiction.

Mitsuko makes an enchanting and spirited heroine as she walks
the paths of Japanese spirits and demons.  A different and
worthwhile read.
