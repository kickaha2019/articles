	It was the title that grabbed me, and made me try this book.
	And the book itself didn't disappoint. The plot itself,
	about Hannah and how her existence becomes anything but
	mundane as it is mixed up with an engaging Devil and
	fantastic deeds and misdeeds, is imaginative. But it is
	the fourth wall breaking story-telling style which shines,
	the authorial voice teasing the reader along.
