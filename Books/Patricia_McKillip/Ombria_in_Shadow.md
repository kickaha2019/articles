*Ombria in Shadow* (2002) is the story of Ombria, and its shadows.
On the surface sinister Domina Pearl weaves her spiderwebs, and
princes die.  Under the surface of Ombria the sorceress Faey
creates poisons and antidotes impartially.  Most of Ombria only
know of one plane of existence.

Faey has made a girl Mag out of wax.  Mag roams freely between shadow
and light and shadow, but one day Mag swallows a golden heart and
changes for ever.

No-one knows Ducon's father.  Ducon draws pictures of the shadows,
of the darknesses in alleyways and doorways.  As Ducon draws he
draws into Ombria things out of the shadows.

*Ombria* is a rich and complex work.  On one level it is about
evil and good, innocence and corruption.  On another level it
is about much more, about the shadows that history and art
and desire cast.  About the shadows that the years cast inside us.

McKillip does not describe everything to the last detail,  does
not explain what happens.  But her writing is full of poetry and
lyricism.

A deserving winner of an award for fantasy.
