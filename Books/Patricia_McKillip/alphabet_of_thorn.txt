 Alphabet of Thorn

Text:
	''Alphabet of Thorn'' (Alphabet of Thorn) is the tale of
	Nepenthe, a foundling abandoned on a cliff edge by her mother
	who is brought up to be a scholar in the large library at
	Raine. One day a strange book written in an alphabet of
	thorns is brought to the library to be translated, and
	Nepenthe becomes addicted to decoding the story in its
	pages. Little knowing where that story will go, or what that
	ancient story will mean for both her library home and the
	kingdom containing the library.

	I like stories within stories, and McKillip resolves both
	storylines in a satisfying way. A beautiful read.
