	''Od Magic'' (2005) is a wondrous many-threaded narrative.
	The wizard Od recruits a new gardener Brendan for her school
	in Kelior, but he is more than he or others suspect.  The kings
	of Kelior have made Od's school more of a way to stifle magic
	than to encourage it, they even fear a trickster Tyramin who
	comes to Kelior to amuse the common people.  Princess Sulys is
	not so sure she wants the future her father has mapped out for
	her.  

	A host of rich well-drawn characters fill this book which is told
	from multiple perspectives.  There's no-one really evil in this
	book, just the way what would be called bureaucracy in our world
	warps the thinking of the people it nominally serves.  ''Od Magic''
	could be seen as both commenting on the way human societies tend
	to get old and gnarly, and also as offering hope that people can
	find their humanity again.

	Whether the magic in ''Od Magic'' is a metaphor for something else,
	or just part of the tapestry of a glorious story, there are a number
	of kinds of magic in ''Od Magic''.  There is the wondrous ancient
	magic which the gardener is in tune with despite himself, there is
	the regulated controlled magic of the school, and there is Tyramin's
	popular magic which exists beneath the radar as far as authority is
	concerned.

	The moral may be that we all need to take a walk on the wild side from
	time to time.  As the magicians from the cloistered school need to get
	out into the Twilight Quarter of Kelior to know what magic really is.

	Wonderful.
