*The Vampire Tree* (1996) is by Paul Halter who has
written a number of detective novels not only in the style of John Dickson
Carr, but set in the milieu that Carr tended to set his novels.
So Paul Halter's books tend to revolve around impossible
crimes and murders inside locked rooms. 

*The Vampire Tree* is more gothic romance than detective fiction.
The heroine Patricia Sheridan moves to live with her husband in
Lightwood, where outside her window is the tree under which 
an accused witch was buried. And the tree by which an impossible
crime was committed. Bit by bit Patricia comes to identify with
Lavinia who was married to the victim, and becomes obsessed
with the tree.

I found this book very readable, all the more for it not completely conforming to
the pattern of the detective genre. There is quite a lot of blood spilled,
crucifix waving, strange dreams, and eerieness. But this book
isn't so much about elaborate setups and baffling events.
