*The White Lady* (2020) is by Paul Halter
and like his other detective novels is faithful to
the style and period of the golden age of detective fiction.

*The White Lady* is set in the 1920s, and features Paul
Halter's detective Owen Burns who admires the art of
a really good and mysterious murder. An aging widower
has taken a young vivacious new wife, and his daughters fear
for their inheritance. A mysterious white lady threatens him
but evades capture by moving through solid walls and fences. An
eccentric soothsayer says murder will follow and it does.
Have the children of someone the widower destroyed come
for revenge?

The clues are all there, the author plays fair with
the reader. The twists and turns are satisfying and
surprising.
