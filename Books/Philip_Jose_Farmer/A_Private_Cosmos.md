"A Private Cosmos" (1968) is the third novel in the *World of Tiers*
series by Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer, set mainly in an artificial
world created by the Lord Jadawin. Farmer's brilliant inventiveness
is exemplified by the World of Tiers itself, shaped like a
tiered wedding cake with different civilisations on each level.
An artificial sun and moon circle this super-monolith. On the
very top is the Palace of the Lord, the God of this universe.

The first book *Maker of Universes* was an odyssey up the world
from Okeanos to the Palace, climbing the mountains of
Thayaphayawoed then Abharhploonta then Doozvillnavava then
Idaquizzoorhruz. This book is more a romp, the first one in the
series to focus on the author's alter-ego of Paul Janus Finnegan
better known as Kickaha, who has taken over the series from Wolff.

Kickaha is involved in a battle against the Bellers, a nightmare
from the Lords' past. This battle takes us over quite a lot of
the World of Tiers, exploring civilisations like Talanac which
Farmer weaves skilfully and convincingly out of his writer's art.
We also meet characters like Podarge from the first book, and
take a trip to the moon!

Farmer has an explicit tribute to Edgar Rice Burroughs here -
on the moon has been recreated some of the denizens from Burroughs'
Mars books. Burroughs was a major figure in the history of
fantastic fiction, avidly read by authors like Farmer and
influencing them.

I first read this memorable book at university, borrowing a copy
from the [CUSFS](http://cusfs.soc.srcf.net) library. I addictedly
turned the pages while the next-door student was blaring forth
Pentangle. Somehow the book and folk music and the period became
entangled in my mind.
