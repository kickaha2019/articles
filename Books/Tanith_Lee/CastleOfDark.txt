	"The Castle of Dark" (published 1978) is a young adult story by Tanith Lee. 
	A girl Lilune is kept secluded in an old deserted castle by two old 
	wise women.  She summons a harper Lir who rescues her, and helps her to
	see the world beyond the castle.  But Lilune is not alone in leaving the
	castle, the dark has left it too and is following her and Lir . . .

	The first time I read this I was struck by the symmetry of the chapters,
	alternating chapters are told from Lilune's then Lir's viewpoints.  
	Tanith Lee is a great crafter of stories, a true stylist of what
	she writes.  The story is also a page-turner, I didn't know where it
	was going yet when it got to the resolution it was the right
	resolution.

	This young adult novel is enriched by Tanith Lee's respinning of
	other mythologies, to create something fresh and new yet 
	archetypal and deep.  So at one stage Lilune is cast into a
	river in a box which makes me think of Osiris.  The guardian hags
	make me think of Macbeth.  The harper Lir by name and calling
	makes me think of Irish legends.

	Wonderful.
