 Companions on the Road

Text:
	"Companions on the Road" (published 1975) is a young adult story by Tanith Lee. Set in a fantasy world two soldiers and a thief loot a golden chalice in a fallen city. But the golden chalice belongs to the satanic lord of the fallen city, and soon the three are being hunted by the shades of the lord and his demonic children. Splendid atmosphere and confident story-telling. The authoress has a gift for including magic in her stories, in such a way that it feels right and appropriate. Great writing.
