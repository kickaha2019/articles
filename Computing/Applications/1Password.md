I'm using
[1Password](https://1password.com/) now for holding passwords and secure data
on the iMac and iPad and iPhone that I use. The product has an iCloud based synching
between the iMac and iPad and iPhone which works nicely.
I do think about using different password managers from time to
time, but 1Password allows you to easily keep tables of information
not just passwords for different sites.

Using some password manager is a must.
