@markdown
I'm using the
[Atom](https://atom.io/) for editing *Markdown* documents
on the iMac. For a free bit of software it works quite well,
a good project view, and a preview which you can see as
you edit the markdown.

It has tended to exit to the desktop more than once or twice.
I haven't found any way of opening the preview tab apart
from right clicking in the project pane.
