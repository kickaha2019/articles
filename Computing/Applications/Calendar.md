I use Apple's [Calendar](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/calendar/welcome/mac)
for keeping track of important dates like birthdays, and
anniversaries, and such-like. A big plus is the synching
between the iMac and iPad etc.

*iCal* was running very slowly on my computer, particularly offensively slowly when I moved between months.  Googling got me to a great suggestion which did the trick for me.

In the *iCal* advanced preferences I turned on the options to delete reminders after a period of time (I put it at 365 days.)  Activating this garbage collection of obsolete entries in *iCal* did the trick for me, and now its performance is acceptable again.
