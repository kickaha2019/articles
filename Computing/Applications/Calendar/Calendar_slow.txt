Title:
	Calendar running slowly

Text:
	''iCal'' was running very slowly on my computer, particularly offensively slowly when I moved between months.  Googling got me to a great suggestion which did the trick for me.

	In the ''iCal'' advanced preferences I turned on the options to delete reminders after a period of time (I put it at 365 days.)  Activating this garbage collection of obsolete entries in ''iCal'' did the trick for me, and now its performance is acceptable again.
