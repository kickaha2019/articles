	Recently I've been finding a number of webpages which want passwords to be entered, yet however they've done it the password fields prevents ordinary cut and paste from working.  This to me is a shame - I use passwords which are long and random so typing them correctly is difficult.  It's much more reliable not to mention quicker to be able to paste them.  Security-wise I would have thought not being able to paste them was bad too.

	Googling got to me to pages like 
	[http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20040120184422156 Paste clipboard contents to secure Safari pages].  
	This was exactly what I needed.  My version of the script is:

Code:
	 -- Paste clipboard into Safari protected field

	-- Pick whatever web browser you are using.
	tell application "Safari"
		activate
	end tell

	set theClip to the clipboard

	-- Type out what is on the clipboard
	tell application "System Events"
		keystroke theClip
	end tell

Text:
	which I run when I have copied the password to the clipboard.
