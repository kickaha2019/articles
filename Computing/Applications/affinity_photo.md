I've been using [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) since October 2017
for editing images on
the iMac. I used to use [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/)'s *Photoshop Elements*, but the version I was using had
problems on the latest version of the Mac operating system and I didn't want
to move to a subscription model that [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) now favour. I'm not a
professional photographer, or even a serious amateur one. [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/)
also has an iPad version which is attractive.

So far [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) has done what I needed to do, it's a little
complicated in places.
