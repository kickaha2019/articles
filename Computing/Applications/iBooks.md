Apple bless them have arbitrarily imposed a limit of 1MB or one
megabyte as the maximum size of any PDF inside iBooks on the iPad.
One workaround is to use Amazon's [Kindle reader](https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp)
on the iPad instead or another PDF reader. Another is to
store the document in iCloud.
