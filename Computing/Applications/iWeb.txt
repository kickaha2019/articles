	[iWeb] is
	[Apple]'s website authoring tool.  Or rather was.
	it's no longer being
	developed, and at some point as [Apple] upgrade the Mac operating system	will
	stop working.  That was an incentive to move off it.

	Under Mountain Lion iWeb still works but will only open the domain
	file it last used, rather than the one you double-clicked on.
	Editing the key ''iWebDefaultsDocumentPath'' in the preferences file
	''com.apple.iWeb.plist'' will change the domain file which iWeb
	opens.  No doubt Apple will stop iWeb working at some point.  To
	simplify life I'm adding into the folder containing the ''Domain''
	file for ''iWeb'' a ''.command'' file containing the code:

Code:
	#!/bin/csh
	defaults write com.apple.iWeb iWebDefaultsDocumentPath "$0:h/Domain.sites2"
	open $0:h/Domain.sites2

	This patches ''iWeb'' preferences then opens the desired domain
	with ''iWeb''.

	[iWeb] is stylish, its templates well-designed.  The GUI lets you position
	and size images and text boxes as you fancy.  The tool is WYSIWYG.  Clever.
	But I don't feel the need when I edit a webpage to know what it's
	going to look like, or to control where text boxes and images appear on
	the page.

	Try doing something outside the lowest common denominator and [iWeb] gets in
	the way rather than helps.  The pretty GUI can be clunky if you have to use
	it much.  [iWeb] is best at simple websites.  Restructuring an [iWeb]
	website means pretty well deleting and recreating pages.

	[iWeb] generates a lot of files, and seems to prefer generating PNGs to JPGs,
	so a [iWeb] website is rather bloated.  Depending on the template used
	some of the path names can end up with spaces in them which can cause
	scripts fun.
	
	Internally [iWeb] uses a lot of Javascript, not only for visual
	effects but to link the pages together (using XML data files.)  This
	means an [iWeb] site is less search engine friendly.

	Some of the files [iWeb] was writing out were not getting backed up 
	by ''Time machine''.  Apple had chosen to set ''com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem'' on some of the image
	files.  I used ''xattr -d'' to remove the attribute but it's a 
	slow process, ''xattr'' seems to be implemented in Python.
