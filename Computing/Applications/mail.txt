	I use Apple's 
	[Mail] for handling email
	on the computer.  Mail in ''Mountain Lion'' is no longer so
	good IMHO as Mail was in Snow Leopard.  The default list view 
	displays very few items unlike the old Mail.

	It is also really dumb
	now about choosing the From Address when you send or reply.
	Instead of taking the From Address based on the email you're
	looking at, Mail takes it from whatever Mail account it comes
	to first.

	As a workaround I'm looking at the ''VIP'' feature inside
	Mail which looks handy.
