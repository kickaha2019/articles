	''Mission Control'' offers a quick graphical view of what's running
	under ''Mountain Lion''.  

	The other thing it offers to me is a replacement for ''Spaces'',
	enabling the use of multiple screenworths of applications.  Even
	with a large display having multiple pages available is very
	useful.
