I use Apple's *Notes* to keep structured notes in. I use *Notes*
in preference to other personal management software because it is
free, and the replication between the Mac and iPad and iPhone works
pretty well, and it has enough features for me.

One downside of *Notes* is how to backup the data in it. If the data
in *Notes* is local to the Mac then one can find a *sqlite3* database
buried inside *~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes*. But that doesn't
contain the data held in iCloud. I did write an Applescript which would
print Note entries to PDF BUT. Apple at Catalina have broken being
able to Applescript Notes. It was too clever really and finicky.
