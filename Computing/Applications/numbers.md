I use Apple's
[Numbers](https://www.apple.com/uk/numbers/) for some spreadsheets on the
computer.  To get scatter charts to work inside [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/uk/numbers/) for some
reason it is necessary to set *Table / Header columns* to *00*
from the top menu. Logarithmic scaling rather than linear is good too.
