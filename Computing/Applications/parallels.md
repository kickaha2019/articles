I use [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/)
to be able to run the Windows operating system on the Mac.
Works pretty well.

Had a glitch after installing Windows 8 onto a virtual
machine though.  Somehow the Parallels virtual machine
lost the network adapter and couldn't access the Internet.
For me reinstalling Parallels Tools got it back, but
other people have had harder time coping with the situation.

Got the error in [Problem ID: 68 Virtual machine cannot be started](https://kb.parallels.com/en/9231) - restarting the Mac seemed to fix that.

A list of games which run under Windows 8 inside Parallels.

Game|Status
-|-
[The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav](https://www.daedalic.com/)|Occasionally hung Parallels on exiting the game or suspending Windows 8
[Deponia](https://www.daedalic.com/)|Played not full-screen plus lower resolution video
[Haunting At Cliffhouse](http://www.mysterymanor.net/Cliffhouse/index.htm)|Ran pretty well
