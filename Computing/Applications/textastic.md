I'm using
[Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) for editing files on my *iPad*.  So when
I'm away on holiday for instance I can type onto the *iPad*
an entry for the holiday there and then.  Or I can edit stuff
while lap-sitting Tabitha.

I have used the
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) integration in [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) for moving files being
edited between the *iPad* and the *Mac*.  Sometimes
synching large numbers of files failed.  I'm probably going to
move over to using the
[WebDAV](https://www.textasticapp.com/v4/manual/lessons/Connecting_to_Textastic_with_Finder.html)
integration in [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) which is more reliable and
free of worries about data privacy in the clouds.

The cursor wheel in [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) is very useful, making it easy
to position the cursor for editing and selecting.  The
extended keyboard in [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) saves having to swap keyboards
when you need special characters.

Perfect?  No, of course not.  But at the moment it
does nicely.
