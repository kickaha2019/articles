Title:
	Textastic (iOS)

Text:
	I'm using 
	[https://www.textasticapp.com/ Textastic] for editing files on my ''iPad''.  So when
	I'm away on holiday for instance I can type onto the ''iPad''
	an entry for the holiday there and then.  Or I can edit stuff
	while lap-sitting Tabitha.

	I have used the 
	[Dropbox] integration in [Textastic] for moving files being
	edited between the ''iPad'' and the ''Mac''.  Sometimes 
	synching large numbers of files failed.  I'm probably going to
	move over to using the
	[https://www.textasticapp.com/v4/manual/lessons/Connecting_to_Textastic_with_Finder.html WebDAV]
	integration in [Textastic] which is more reliable and
	free of worries about data privacy in the clouds.

	The cursor wheel in [Textastic] is very useful, making it easy 
	to position the cursor for editing and selecting.  The
	extended keyboard in [Textastic] saves having to swap keyboards
	when you need special characters.

	Perfect?  No, of course not.  But at the moment it
	does nicely.
