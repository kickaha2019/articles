If you've got anything on a computer it needs to be backed up.
There's a lot of accidents waiting to happen from disk problems
(and SSD disks can lose data worse than hard drives) through
human error to viruses and even theft. There's a lot of options
and for the record I'm going to list what I do.

Everynight I use Apple's [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250)
to backup the files on the iMac to an external hard drive.
[Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) keeps old versions of files which has been
very useful in the past. It's not necessarily perfect - I have
seen it confused by files changing path not timestamp. I also
currently use [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) to backup to external hard drives
I keep offsite.

I also use [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
as a way of maintaining cloud backups of files.
I synch an external drive with [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) which helps
reduce the storage used on the main drive, as I keep
not actively files on it yet have confidence they are
backed up.

Photographs and other Apple documents are synched to the cloud
using Apple's [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207428) storage.
