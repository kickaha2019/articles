	If you've got anything on a computer it needs to be backed up.
	There's a lot of accidents waiting to happen from disk problems
	(and SSD disks can lose data worse than hard drives) through
	human error to viruses and even theft. There's a lot of options
	and for the record I'm going to list what I do.

	Everynight I use Apple's [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250 Time Machine]
	to backup the files on the iMac to an external hard drive.
	[Time Machine] keeps old versions of files which has been
	very useful in the past. It's not necessarily perfect - I have
	seen it confused by files changing path not timestamp. I also
	currently use [Time Machine] to backup to external hard drives
	I keep offsite.

	I also use [https://www.google.com/drive/ Google Drive]
  as a way of maintaining cloud backups of files.
  I synch an external drive with [Google Drive] which helps
  reduce the storage used on the main drive, as I keep
  not actively files on it yet have confidence they are
  backed up.

	Photographs and other Apple documents are synched to the cloud
	using Apple's [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207428 iCloud] storage.
