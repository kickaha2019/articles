	Recently I've been scanning some of the thousands of slides I have so
	I can free up space. I do have a slide projector but haven't used it in
	over a decade - we don't even have a wall to projects slides onto. The slides
	themselves take up space.

	The scanning (using a CanoScan 9000F) has gone surprisingly well. The images are
	not as high resolution as a modern digital camera, one needs to clean the slides
	carefully before scanning, but the results are very acceptable for my needs.
	There's just one problem - the metadata in the images says the images date from
	when I scanned them, which leads to them getting filed under 2017 inside
	[Photo] when they should be filed under 1987.

	So I been patching the dates on the scanned images using a very versatile
	utility called [ExifTool]. There's other software out there which no doubt would do
	a similar job but [ExifTool] has worked well for me.

	Late in the day I discovered that Apple's [Photo] does let you edit the dates
	on the pictures so I don't need to patch the dates this way. Patching them inside
	[Photo] is even better as the photos will be sorted in scan order which is
	what I want.
