Title:
	Domain Specific Languages

Text:
	A domain specific language (DSL) is a great way of 
	implementing systems focussed on particular areas.  You
	can write everything in your favourite general-purpose
	language (be it ''Ruby'' ''Java'' or assembler
	language).  But there are advantages to using a DSL.
	
	A popular example.  [https://cucumber.io/ Cucumber] uses a DSL called
	Gherkin to write its scenarios in for BDD testing.
	There are a number of advantages in using a DSL like
	Gherkin to program in rather than a general-purpose
	language.  Firstly the code is much more readable, less
	obfuscated with special syntax.  Secondly the DSL isolates
	the code from the next layer of software technology.  In the
	case of Gherkin one could run the same scenarios not on
	a Ruby based Cucumber but on a Perl imitation.  Lastly
	the DSL restricts what can be coded - it is as bad to have
	10 ways of doing something as to have none.
	
	In my hobby software development I've devised some homespun
	DSLs which I find useful.  One is for scraping information
	off webpages.  An example of this 'DSL':
	
Code:
	every TD
	attribute class Class
	match Class "dataRowL"
	text Date
	next TD
	text Description
	next TD
	text Amount
	if
		match Amount "\D*(\d+.\d+)\D*" Value
		write Account Date Description Value ""
	endif

Text:
	This code snippet goes through every TD in a HTML 
	page, check for those with class "dataRowL", then
	gets a date, description, and amount from the following
	TD fields.  If the amount is a number then it
	writes out the details.

	These webpages also use a very simple DSL.  For illustration
	here is this webpage as coded:
