[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is what I've been doing most of my programming
in over recent years.  At home I use it for more heavyweight
applications than I would tackle in *Ruby*.

The good points are Java's relative platform independence,
and availability of libraries to do a range of operations.

The bad points are Java is still close to the metal in
many ways, there are multiple libraries around for area
(I've worked on systems which 3-4 different libraries at
the same time for XML handling.)

And Java isn't supported on the iPad.

As an IDE I use [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/).  The GUI is simpler than
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) which I use at work. I don't like the
switching between windows in Eclipse.
