Text:
	[https://php.net/ PHP] is a scripting language especially for web servers
	generating [https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp HTML] pages.  I use for a few of my webpages,
	particularly where data is being retrieved from a
	[https://www.mysql.com/ MySQL] database.
	
	For generating webpages it's cheap and cheerful.  On all
	the webhosts I've used PHP has been available.  The 
	language is similar to a lot of other languages with
	some gotchas.  For instance:
	
Code:
	"Hello " + "World"
	
Text:
	does not give "Hello World" but 0.  The string concatenation
	operator is "." not "+".  I fall over that every time.
