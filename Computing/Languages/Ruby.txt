Title:
	Ruby

Text:
	[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ Ruby] is currently the computing language I first reach
	for when I want to implement something.  I'm not going to claim
	it's the greatest language, that's both subjective and depends on
	what you want to implement.  But for me Ruby has a lot of neat 
	features that I like.

	Ruby is a scripting language so I can just code and run, there's
	no compile cycle, no need for declarations to tell the language
	what a variable is.  It's an expressive language and I've got used
	to using blocks and saying more in less lines of code.  So to
	look for "Error" in a log file one can go:

Code:
	IO.readlines( "run.log").each do |line|
		raise "Error" if /Error/ =~ line
	end

Text:
	Ruby has numerous helpful shortcuts, for example in the code 
	above there's an
	if after the statement it's guarding.  Other shortcuts
	are omitting the () if calling a method with no arguments,
	the return value defaulting to the value of the last
	statement in a method.

	One can subtract arrays and get something sensible so
	for instance:

Code:
	[1,2,3] - [2] => [1,3]

Text:
	that is element 2 has been removed from elements 1,2,3.

	All in all Ruby is an expressive language with a lot of
	people contributing libraries to it.  But it can be learnt 
	in an afternoon.
