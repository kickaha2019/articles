	Variable scoping in Ruby can be a little surprising, 
	especially as it's not consistent between versions of Ruby. 

	So code like:

Code:
	 (1..10).each do |i|	 	(1..10).each { |i| }	 	puts i	 end

	on the Mac using Ruby 1.8.7 perversely gives as output:

Code:
	10	10	10	10	10	10	10	10	10	10
