A conceit but there is an
[interactive map](../../Map/index.html) on this website. It displays markers
on a zoomable map of places visited. The markers link to webpages
describing visits to those places. This depends on metadata for the
webpages (as well as kml data from [Google Maps](Google Maps)).

So for example the [Florida 2001](2001/Florida) page has metadata including:

~~~
---
anchors:
- Disneyworld
~~~

Here follows a list of the anchors for this website.

|Name|Lat|Lon|Link|
|-|-|-|-|
<%=
    html = []
    anchors.keys.sort.each do |name|
      html << "#{name}|#{anchors[name][:lat]}|#{anchors[name][:lon]}|#{anchors[name][:links][0]}"
    end
    html.join("\n")
%>
