Title:
	Hosting

Text:
	Some people host their website from their own computers, me I rely on
	shared hosting to host mine. I've moved around different hosting
	companies a little, more down to technical issues than price.

	The latest hosting company I'm on ([Dreamhost]) have plenty of
	features for me. SSH supported, free SSL, SSD drives to speed things
	up. Support ticket system could be better but with patience OK.
	PHP 7 broke my website but that's not their fault.
