The *List* declaration can be used to create a tabular section on
an article page where the headings are down the first column.  So for example:

~~~
false
false
false
false
false
~~~
Comes out as:

| | |
|-|-|
Fruit|Banana
Colour|Yellow
Shape|Curved

Each row is a new line in the *List* declaration.  The column values
are separated by *|*s.

The column values can contain links and bolded strings as in the *Text*
declaration.
