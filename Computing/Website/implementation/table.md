The *Table* declaration can be used to create a tabular section on
an article page where the headings are across the top.  So for example:

~~~
false
false
false
false
false
~~~
Comes out as:

Fruit|Colour
-|-
Banana|Yellow
Cherry|Red

Each row is a new line in the *Table* declaration.  The column values
are separated by *|*s.

The column values can contain links and bolded strings as in the *Text*
declaration.
