The name for an article by default is derived from its filename without any extension.
Underscores in the filename are replaced by spaces, if all the letters in the filename are
lowercase then initial letters will be capitalised.  Filenames can only be so long to fit
in the index on the LHS of an article page.

The name of an article is used in three places.  In the index of the LHS of an article page,
at the top of the RHS for the article page itself, and in the listing of the children for
the parent article.  To override the name used for the last two places the "Title" declaration
can be used.  As an example:

~~~
false
false
~~~
