	I've just installed [Affinity Photo] (October 2017)
	to use for editing images on
	the iMac. I used to use [Adobe]'s ''Photoshop Elements'', but the version I was using had
	problems on the latest version of the Mac operating system and I didn't want
	to move to a subscription model that [Adobe] now favour. I'm not a
	professional photographer, or even a serious amateur one. [Affinity Photo]
	also has an iPad version which is attractive.

	So far [Affinity Photo] looks like it will do what I need it to do.
