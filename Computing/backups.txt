Title:
	Backups

Text:
	If you've got anything on a computer it needs to be backed up.
	There's a lot of accidents waiting to happen from disk problems
	(and SSD disks can lose data worse than hard drives) through
	human error to viruses and even theft. There's a lot of options
	and for the record I'm going to list what I do.

	Everynight I use Apple's [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250 Time Machine]
	to backup the files on the iMac to an external hard drive.
	[Time Machine] keeps old versions of files which has been
	very useful in the past. It's not necessarily perfect - I have
	seen it confused by files changing path not timestamp. I also
	currently use [Time Machine] to backup to external hard drives
	I keep offsite.

	I've started using [https://bombich.com/ Carbon Copy Cloner] to
	maintain a bootable backup. I went for [Carbon Copy Cloner]
	because I've used it in the past. I've no reason to think other
	products like [https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html Super Duper] would not serve as well for my needs.

	I'm going to regularly make encrypted DMG images of areas of the file system
	and upload them periodically using [https://cyberduck.io/?l=en Cyberduck] to
	[https://aws.amazon.com/s3/ Amazon S3]. I did investigate
	using products like [https://www.arqbackup.com/ ARQBackup] and [Chronosync]
	to backup my filesystem to the cloud. I also tried using
	[https://www.google.com/drive/ Google Drive] as a way of maintaining cloud backups of files.
	These look like good products but both the speed of my Internet
	connection, and the numbers of small files involved meant it
	was infeasible to sync the file system as-is to the cloud. 

	Photographs and other Apple documents are synched to the cloud
	using Apple's [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207428 iCloud] storage.
