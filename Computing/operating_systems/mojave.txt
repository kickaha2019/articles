Title:
	Issues on OSX 10.14 (Mojave)

Text:
	Open With menu doesn't correctly report the default application.
  For me .txt files always claim to open inside TextEdit by default
  though in practice I have them opening inside XCode.

Text:
	Apple have tightened up access to files underneath ~/Library. For instance
 from the command line you can't see files underneath ~/Library/Mail.
