Title:
	Issues on OSX 10.14 (Mojave)

Text:
	Open With menu doesn't correctly report the default application.
  For me .txt files always claim to open inside TextEdit by default
  though in practice I have them opening inside XCode.

Text:
	Apple have tightened up access to files underneath ~/Library. For instance
  from the command line you can't see files underneath ~/Library/Mail.

Code:
  Under ''Security & Privacy'' in ''System Preferences'' you can enable
  applications like Terminal to have ''Full Disk Access'. This is weakening
  security of course.
  
Text:
  Unable to move to Junk folder because Mailbox ??? does not exist.

Code:
  In Mail Preferences/Accounts check that Junk mailboxes are properly defined.
