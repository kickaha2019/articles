	I'm now on OSX 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion) thanks to 
	a new computer.  A bit of a change to OSX 10.6
	(Snow Leopard) !
	
	The scroll wheel on the Microsoft mouse doesn't
	work very happily any more.  With a little
	regret the Bluetooth Magic Mouse Apple supplied
	is in use, together with a trackball.  I've
	replaced the limited Bluetooth keyboard with
	a USB keyboard with a fuller set of keys like
	DELETE.
	
	If there is a light to show the iMac has power
	I haven't spotted it yet.
	
	One of the accounts imported from the old computer
	lost its password, the other didn't.
	
	British English isn't very well represented in the
	system messages.  Unless you move English to be the
	second choice you get a lot of dialogs coming out in
	Danish.
	
	Apple have tried to block shell scripts being run from mounted
	volumes.  I moved the scripts onto the startup volume but
	other people have had more success in defeating Apple's 
	nanny-mindedness.

	Sometimes the list of applications to open a file with ends
	up with multiple entries.  What worked for me was doing a
	''Safe Boot'' (hold down shift key when restarting the 
	computer), then a normal boot.
