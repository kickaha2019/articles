	[JUnit4] tests inside [https://netbeans.org/ Netbeans] run slowly. Seems to be a 5-second
	overhead per test class.

	''/etc/hosts'' needs to contain the hostname for the computer mapped to
	127.0.0.1 and ::1. See [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33289695/inetaddress-getlocalhost-slow-to-run-30-seconds/33289897 Stack Overflow].

	Kept getting ''Enter passphrase'' for access to ''id_rsa'' key file.

Code:
	Needed to run ''ssh-add -K id_rsa'' to add passphrase to new correct keychain location
	for macOS to use.
