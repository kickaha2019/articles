I need the subtitles for a lot of films and TV that I watch. There's many
people out there who for the love of it produce subtitles for TV shows and
films, for instance the volunteers for [Viki](https://www.viki.com/) to name but one group. And I'm
grateful to them.

There are sites on the web where subtitles in various formats can be downloaded,
but some the links on the subtitle websites go to places that well behaved
browsers shouldn't go to. Places that will try to infect your computer by
various means.
