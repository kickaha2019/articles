The SubRip file format may be the most basic of subtitle file formats but it
is very useful. There's information on it on the
[Matro&scaron;ka](https://matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html) website,
but you can work out the format by looking at a *.srt* file in a text
editor. Note that as SubRip was written by a European a comma "*,*" is
used rather than a fullstop "*.*" for the decimal point separator.

An example:

~~~
1
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,647
Once every 120 years...

2
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:46,920
A "shinigami" appears
from the eastern seas.

3
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:49,289
What is a "shinigami?
