The SubRip file format may be the most basic of subtitle file formats but it
is very useful. There's information on it on the
[Matro&scaron;ka](https://matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html) website,
but you can work out the format by looking at a *.srt* file in a text
editor. Note that as SubRip was written by a European a comma "*,*" is
used rather than a fullstop "*.*" for the decimal point separator.

An example:
