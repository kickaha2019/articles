*Kings Canyon* (also in the Red Centre) is nowhere near the impossible size of the Grand Canyon but has charms. The steep climb up to the walk round the canyon rim nearly did for me (it does get better.) The limestone is white when newly broken but discolours steadily giving the ice-cream look of the walls.

An Englishwoman is credited with introducing paddy melons from SE Asia to this area. The birdlife like galaks roll the fruit to the side of roads hoping cars will break the fruit open. Driving through the area I thought there were different species of trees to be seen but they were all avatars of the desert oak. When young this looks like a fir but on its roots finding water it branches out and looks like an oak.
