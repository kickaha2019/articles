![Lake Barrine](lake_barrine.JPG)
[Lake Barrine](https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/parks/lake-barrine/) is a rainwater lake in an extinct volcano. In the clear water you can see fallen trees. You only notice later what you didn't photograph and I didn't photograph the lake ... sigh. There's quite a bit of wildlife around, from the Kauri pines near the visitor centre to the birdlife like cormorants and coots.

There's a good boat ride round the lake with a naturalist showing you stuff. Necessary as I wouldn't spot it on my own. At one spot he noticed an amethyst python in the rushes and it took me minutes to see it even knowing which direction to look in. This python is blue and white striped.
