	I stopped over in Singapore both on the way out and way back. The only place I've been where I didn't have to queue going through immigration. Subway trains clean and safe and functional and open. A city of people upon people, buildings upon buildings.

	Singapore is a multinational place, it's underground has four languages. The city is like the convergence of human rivers. Singapore hotels have UK style electrical sockets in them by the way. Useful when I was recharging batteries. Did see the world famous Raffles Hotel - looked so out of place and small among modern architectures.
