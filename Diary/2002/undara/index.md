[Undara](https://www.undara.com.au/) is out in the Outback or so it feels - getting there you drive along long sections of one track highway having to go onto the hard shoulder whenever you meet anything. But you can drive for miles and miles and see zilch. Well it's kilometres and kilometres as Oz is metric. And I did stop at the Ravenshoe Wind Farm on the way.

What's at Undara? Collapsed lava tubes from a massive volcanic eruption - longest lava tubes on the planet I was told! Did a tour with a Scottish tour guide who kept making digs at the English.
