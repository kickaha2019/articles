	[https://parksaustralia.gov.au/kakadu/discover/regions/yellow-water/ Yellow Waters] is a wetlands area where you can do a great sunrise boat ride and see heaps of wildlife.

	The boat seats are wet first thing so take something to sit on.

	One sees a lot of paperbark trees. They have two root systems, one for the dry one for the wet season.

	I had seen the darter or snake neck bird as the anhinga in the States. They like to stand and dry their wings - or warm what they've just eaten.

  I also took in a cruise down [https://nt.gov.au/leisure/parks-reserves/find-a-park/find-a-park-to-visit/nitmiluk-national-park Nitmiluk Gorge].
