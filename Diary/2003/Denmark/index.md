I visited friends I knew from Waterbeach who were now living in Denmark. I will go a long way to see friends.

Spent a very pleasant time seeing the evil monster sand dune which is crossing the tip of Denmark at *R&aring;jberg Mile*,
watching seas meet up at the *Skagen Peninsula*, sampled the food in a Jensens Bofhus (literally Beef house), seeing an ancient Viking burial field
at [Lindholm H&oslash;je](https://www.visitaalborg.com/ln-int/lindholm-hoje-gdk596081) and getting a little lost in a forest park.

I like lightning storms and there was a marvellous one the night before I left.
