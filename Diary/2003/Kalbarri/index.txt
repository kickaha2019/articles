	Not a great start to my road odyssey as I got lost walking to the car hire place and when I did get there it was deserted. By the time I got a car I felt I needed a holiday. Took ages to get out of the Perth area and then it was a long haul up to
 [https://www.cgg.wa.gov.au/ Geraldton] where I stayed the night. The driving in Australia is pretty boring - hours can pass with no change in the scenery - but there was some variation in the colours of the bugs squashed on the windscreen. The car got dirty in quick order.

	In Geraldton I saw a Roman Catholic cathedral designed by Monsignor Hawes who came from Britain. The interior has a candy stripe colour scheme (I was told in lieu of marble.) The building had a sense of holiness for me.

	I was accommodated at the ''Greengables Lodge'' which had an imposing palm lined approach and a young puppy which tried out its teeth on my trousers. The hosts were friendly and treat guests as almost part of the family - you can eat supper with them. There was a strong teddy bear theme in the decor.

	The next day I drove up to Denham at Shark Bay going via Kalbarri. Saw the
  [https://www.westernaustralia.com/en/Attraction/Hutt_Lagoon/59cb40e112f8967834c0e22f#/ Hutt Lagoon] close to Gregory which is a coastal brine lake with a striking pink colour. The lake is home to the alga Dunaliella salina which is abundant because it is favoured by the high salinity and low nutrient levels. It has a pink (beta-carotene) pigment.

	Impressive coastline going up to Kalbarri where I had potato wedges to keep me going and also found Internet access to keep in touch with people back home.

	Drove through the [https://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/park/kalbarri Kalbarri National Park] but it wasn't the carpet of wildflowers I had been envisaging. Seems like I was too late for that. If one did venture out into the scrubland bushes then one found that what seemed uniform was a mob of different plant species. There were tiny flowers of many hues and forms to enchant the eye.
