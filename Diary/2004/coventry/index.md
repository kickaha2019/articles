I went to the 2004 Adventure Convention in Coventry,
staying at the [Allesley Hotel](https://www.allesleyhotel.com/). This is partly a social occasion to catch up with friends I see each year. Most of those there started with text adventures and some still produce them. Each year someone does a text adventure which is is used for the Megapoints Competition - the only time I play text adventures now. There is still life in text adventures - this year's game by David Hebblethwaite entitled "No Milk Today" was fresh and amusing.

After a hunt through Coventry for a firewire cable I showed my efforts in the line of graphic adventures. Some there were inspired by how possible it is to do a game just using pictures from a digital camera. I look forward to what they may produce.
