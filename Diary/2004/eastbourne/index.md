Virginia and I had a long weekend in *Eastbourne*. This resort on Britain's south coast seems to be a favourite resort for the elderly judging by the numbers sitting in hotel balconies. The pier was a little rundown but had a shop making and selling glass ornaments, I got Virginia a small glass elephant.

Got caught out by the rain several times. Enjoyed a museum of shops of yesteryear as well as the Science Park at the old
[Herstmonceux Observatory](https://www.the-observatory.org/). Some marvellous machines to play with.
