	Virginia and I had a long weekend in ''Eastbourne''. This resort on Britain's south coast seems to be a favourite resort for the elderly judging by the numbers sitting in hotel balconies. The pier was a little rundown but had a shop making and selling glass ornaments, I got Virginia a small glass elephant.

	Got caught out by the rain several times. Enjoyed a museum of shops of yesteryear as well as the Science Park at the old
 [https://www.the-observatory.org/ Herstmonceux Observatory]. Some marvellous machines to play with.
