Virginia and I got married in July then had a honeymoon in the Lake District. The wedding passed off well - the sun shone at the right times for the pictures, I survived making a speech in public.

The Lake District is a key area for me because of the Arthur Ransome connections. His Swallows and Amazons books are key images to me. But the Lakes have other connections - Beatrix Potter who in later life was important in Britain's National Trust. The Lake poets. Just the harmonious scenery. A place to wander lonely as a cloud - but we stayed in the valleys.
