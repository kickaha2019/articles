A mass of people from families on outings to enthusiasts with prodigious lenses on their cameras. A mass of stalls from perfume shops through funfair antics to authentic pilot uniforms. Ice-cream and burger stalls. Like being at the beach save it was airfield grass. Hard to find Virginia's male relatives again after I wandered off in search of amenities. A long search it was too.

We were there to see a circus of flying machines. It had a lot in common with the circus. Aerobatics rather than acrobatics. Dizzying. Mad behaviour like the wing walking. Displays of power like the jumpjet standing still or what impressed me a helicopter doing a loop. Nostalgic flights from WW2 aircraft. We left before the end which may have saved us time - the access roads to Biggin Hill are not good.
