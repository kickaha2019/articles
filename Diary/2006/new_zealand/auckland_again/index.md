Another depressing day. Rain and wind caused the Tiri Tiri Matangi trip to be cancelled. Went and saw Gannets at Murawai – Good but so breezy I was afraid of losing dad's camera. Saw "Aeon flux" at the cinema– passable. Returned car to airport and had an expensive New Zealand dollar 60 taxi ride back for only a few miles. Auckland is gridlocked most times of the day. Recommendation – avoid Auckland– traffic issues, stay multiple nights some places, have backup plans – over commit. Average speed 60 km an hour safe reckoning.

We went to the museum in Auckland domain (good including a live dinosaur for the children, unsettling!) In the afternoon we all went to Kelly Tarlton's Antarctic experience (including a Disney World like ride to see penguins and stingray feeding.) Ate at the GPK restaurant (tipping not expected.) I paid as a way of saying thank you to Vicky and Bruce and all.
