Washout day. Left vouchers behind at Oak Lodge in Greymouth – only realised this when I got to Kaikoura so back we went for nine hours of solid driving. So I did Lewis Pass twice!

Pretty low and worn out. The people at Oak Lodge were really super, letting me stay in the blue room again. Such kindness I wouldn't expect in the UK or felt I deserved.

Went over Arthur's pass the day after from Greymouth to Christchurch. Highlight was a Maori Stonehenge – an area of limestone pillars and a centre of Maori spirituality in the past. Worst food ever at Christchurch airport restaurant.
