![Yellow eyed penguin colony at Otago Peninsula](penguin_colony.jpg)
Most of my trip was arranged for me by
[Nature Quest](https://www.naturequest.co.nz/).
I would go with them again for wildlife and nature tours.

The first three days I had the benefit of a guide which was a real privilege. Not only did I get to see birds and other things which I wouldn't have done otherwise, but also it made the trip more human and social.

Saw Dunedin in South Island, birding in local area, did Yellow Eye penguin colony, and Monarch cruise at Taiaroa Head for Royal Albatross.

Dire start to my Odyssey – couldn't sleep last night – Bruce ensured I was up and we got to the airport in time for me to join a chaotic queue of queues. Checking in was a nightmare, and then there was another massive queue to get through security. And I only got on the plane as they said final boarding – and I wasn't the last! Met up with Wynston Cooper (ex POC person) fine I had a good day birding and being around Dunedin.
