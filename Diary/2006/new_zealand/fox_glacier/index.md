Went wrong and headed south not north at Haast for many kilometres! Homestays like B&Bs but more being like in someone's home, typically no keys handed out. New Zealand roads are good but not over flowing with signs and mileages. Petrol stations can be few and far between. Internet access good. Did Minnehaha walk at Fox Glacier, Knight's Point Lookout, Ships Creek walk, stopped several times in Haast pass for pictures. 

Cadrona pass has you driving down gully. Wandered round a little of Lake Matheson and heard birds singing – tuis someone said – dining at High Peaks restaurant – in the middle of nowhere get gourmet and refined.

My fox Homestay has pukehos in its back yard (White tail rough sign of danger) and also Paradise ducks. Went and saw the glow worms in the grotto – not exactly earth shattering. Tiny white pinpricks of light scattered on low branches!
