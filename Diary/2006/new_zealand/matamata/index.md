![Matamata - Hobbiton in the 'Lord of the Rings' films](hobbiton.jpg)
Dreamt a dream influenced by Lirael. Slept quite well on the bed upstairs up the wooden ladder. No sign of the host so I just left and went to a private bird sanctuary at Otorohanga. Saw a tub and kiwis in dark enclosures.

Asked for advice on what to do with the rest of the day and ended up doing to see Hobbiton at Matamata. Quite interesting, despite my preconceptions. Security conscious filming â€“ they had security people secretly photographing those trying to snap secretly. Oak tree dead - cut up and reassembled. Bought up vegetable growing and modelling companies. Aim to imitate little England of Tolkien. Said Tolkien taught himself Finnish at 15? Hit Auckland rush hour getting back to Vicky and Bruce's. Having problems charging here in New Zealand. New Zealand army built access road in Matamata.
