Walked to see Franz Josef glacier over a rocky moraine floor. I didn't touch the glacier itself, but got close enough to hear the melt water chortle away. Tried Okarito but it didn't seem worth the effort. Went up to Punakaiki but the blowholes weren't blow-holing – loads of tourist coaches as well. The rocks are pleasingly layered (Like pancakes you could see).

Oak Lodge just north of Greymouth is a posh place. I'm in the blue room! They have pukehos as well on nomansland round a brook – one picture may be worth having. They let me use their Internet. The room is palatial as is the house. A small holding unlike the homestead which had thousands of acres if I recall properly. Walked around Greymouth little before eating at McDonald's – not the most exciting places, rather grey, but that's okay. Weird one way bridges now with train tracks as well.
