![Lake near Te Anau](te_anau_lakes.jpg)
Snow has fallen on the high hills. Rippled mirrors at Mirror Lakes. At Cascade Creek saw Robin and a small bird white fantail black stripe and needle tail single high pitched note. Cascade Creek had a wondrous beech (not true European beech) forest where green moss covered everything like unearthly snow. IPad recharged at Stewart Island not Te Anau. Robin is the white black striped fantails. Saw Kea at Chasm – albeit in the car park scrounging! This on the way from Te Anau to Milford Sound where I did a cruise.

Fiordland is majestic - Doubtful Sound may have been less tourist infested but Milford Sound had stunning scenery. Homer Tunnel on way like mine, poorly lit and rough sided.
Milford Sound itself had water the colour dark of treacle – at falls there were rainbows. The boat was quite full – sadly some smoking – Huntsville Alabama resident who had never met anyone from the UK. English sockets on board ship? People with orange sacks.

Ate at Chinese place at Te Anau – too much food - chicken meat seemed to be shaped like dinosaur. Chinese bosses sat while wife waited. Mixed mandarin/Cantonese.
