We got up bright and early – had the cardboard breakfast that the Devonwood offered then set off to Te Puai for the fumaroles. Not too much sulphur – saw some of the geysers bubbling away. Wish I had more time at Rotorua but felt I needed to get over to Waitomo.

The spellbound tour was good – a splendid glide of a boat ride down a a subterranean river towards a waterfall. Overhead the glow-worms glowed like stars. Great, and there was solid commentary from our guide about their life-cycle. Though I didn't see the waterfall at the end. In the second cave there was a cave weta which I got too close to take reasonable pictures off. Found my self staying at Te Tiro ("The view" in Maori) – the Tuggles Gap of Tuggles gap. Te Tiro has a great view over the North Island but is really miles from anywhere, Down farm tracks with cryptic signs to be followed. Mobile phone a good idea.

Feijoia juice, kumara good food. Glow-worm in maggot having threads down, blue green light to attract flies – then pupal then three days adult– Female glows to attract mail – lays 40 or so eggs. Cycle about nine months long. Te Tiro has outside loo which you have to grope your way to in the dark–also has its own glowworm Grotto.
