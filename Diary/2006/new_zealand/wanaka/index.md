![Puzzling World at Wanaka](puzzling_world.jpg)
The set of batteries were not charged at Stewart Island –
so power too low there? Did a batch of washing at Te Anau (Wash 'n surf – quite good combination.) Drove past Lake up to Queenstown junction, ate at shopping centre Millars? then drove to homestay at Wanaka – more social than B&B. Did Puzzleworld at Wanaka – great fun – did maze simply in 45 minutes. Ate at Finchy's, watched rugby at their lounge. Seasonal but very crowded in February. Millennium tiles here. Saw Arrowtown Chinese miner's village.
