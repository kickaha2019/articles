We managed the excursion to Grieg's house in Bergen, the last port of call, despite worrying about whether we would walk back in time to the coach. I need something to worry about. There was a great piano recital here by a local Bergen pianist dressed in traditional Norwegian gear. She really attacked the keyboard, and to me interpreted Grieg's music better than Mary Bruce.

Grieg's house was a wooden somewhat ramshackle effort to me. Wood is used a lot in Norway - the Stave churches (which look more like Viking temples) are famous. Norwegians have a lot of natural resources, they say when their oil runs out they'll keep going on their freshwater reserves. There's a lot of water bottled up in the mighty Joksdal Glacier field.

And then we returned home to a rainy overcast UK. How to summarise? I would cruise again. It's an easy holiday where you don't have to worry about finding your way around. Time appeared in the day for me to do Araucaria crosswords, and read "Mister Monday" by Garth Nix. But best of all was having time to meet other people in a relaxed atmosphere. We did apply for a table for two but I was glad we didn't get it - spending real time with other people is one of the pleasures of life.
