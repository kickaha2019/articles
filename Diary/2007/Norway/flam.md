Stavanger was rather flat, not real Norway (or the Norway of my imagining.) Our next stop was better - Flam said Flum. There tender waterfalls fell down steep mountains from snowy heights into deep mysterious waters. Picture postcard stuff. I took the train from Flam up to Vatnahalsen and back. The train winds around inside the mountain like a lost troll. You're allowed off at Kjosfossen to see the waterfall and that is a must do.
