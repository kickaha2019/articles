![Walk to the Glacier](walk_glacier.JPG)
We next docked at Olden and attempted the walk to the Brikdal Glacier. It was here that we, or rather Virginia, had a mishap. She sprained an ankle walking on the rough ground by the melt-water lake at the foot of the glacier. Not so good but better than one unfortunate cruise passenger who broke a leg on the first day in Stavanger. Virginia managed to hobble down bravely as the rains came - we had had good weather up to then. So we explored a new part of the "Artemis" to whit the ISO 9001 certified medical centre. The bill was added to our tab.
