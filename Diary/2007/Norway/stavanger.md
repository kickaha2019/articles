![Old Stavanger](old_stavanger.JPG)
We had booked excursions before we sailed. One could save money here by buying train tickets etc oneself when one's there. We didn't spend all the Norwegian money we took as Norway proved to be a very expensive place. So expensive Norwegians catch ferries to Newcastle to go shopping. Stavanger, our first port of call, was rather closed up on the Sunday. An Italian guide led us round an Iron Age Farm, picturesque wooden buildings in Gamle (Old) Stavanger, and where three massive swords stand to mark Harald Fairhair unifying Norway centuries ago. The Iron Age Farm was informative from how they prepared woad to dye their wool blue to Norse myths justifying the blond-haired enslaving the darker haired.
