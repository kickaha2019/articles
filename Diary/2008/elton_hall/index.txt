	Virginia and I went to 
	[http://eltonhall.com/ Elton Hall] near Peterborough for another stately home. Elton Hall is still lived in by the Proby family, rather than being looked after by the National Trust.

	We saw the furniture, the books, the porcelain, the silverware, the paintings that the rich have - the guides were very helpful and informative - but a question for me remains. What is it like to be in that social class? How do the people who live there think?
