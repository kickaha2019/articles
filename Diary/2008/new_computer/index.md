Virginia and I are now using a Macbook Pro at home running Leopard (OSX 10.5.1)   There were reasons for replacing the G5 iMac we had before, apart from a new toy for the boy who likes the computer kind of toys.

The games I like playing are mainly to be found on Windows so dual-booting the Macbook will save having two computers at home.

My website to date had been done using homegrown and idiosyncratic software, which was burdensome to maintain. The plan is to convert as much as possible over to
[Apple](https://www.apple.com/)'s iWeb and save on effort there.   This page
before it was converted from iWeb was the start of that project!
