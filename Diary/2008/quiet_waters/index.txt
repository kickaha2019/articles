	Virginia and I went on a retreat to 
	[Quiet Waters], 
	which is just outside Bungay in Suffolk. We liked it so much we went on a second retreat in late August as well.

	A great ambience of calm.   Well looked after by the amiable people who ran the place, it was good to share meals with them.   One interesting session with assigning patience and other virtues to fruits, and saying why one had so assigned.   Didn't see the kingfisher which was rumoured to be around though. Did see bats flying at dusk.

	Bungay itself has character including a ruined castle accidentally located behind a tea room, and a secondhand bookshop I had to resist buying books in.
