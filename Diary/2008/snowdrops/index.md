Virginia and I belong to the
[National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/),
and one of their nearby places is
[Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill).
The gardens are open in January and February to see snowdrops (they have 170 different varieties here!)

There is some artifice in the gardens, the whiteness of the silver birch is apparently due to washing up liquid, but it is a very beautiful place to visit and be enchanted by.     The colours and shapes and textures in the plants is intoxicating.
