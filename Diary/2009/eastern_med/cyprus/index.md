![Where Aphrodite was born in Cyprus](aphrodite_born.JPG)
After Egypt visiting Cyprus was serenity. We drove from Limassol through citrus plantations to Paphos (driving on the left as in the UK.) Long lectures on the coach about the disaster area that is Greek mythology. We passed through a UK military base in Cyprus, strange to see a slice of home in an alien soil. Cyprus has low rainfall, and has relied on tankers of fresh water from Greece in the past. We did get to see where Aphrodite emerged from the sea (don't know if different Greek places all claim that, wouldn't be surprised.)

The tour focussed on the Roman and Greek mosaics found at Paphos. The images were taken from Greek mythology, and were well presented. Here as elsewhere it felt like conveyor-belt tourism, different parties being shepherded through the system like cows at a cattle market. We had some refreshments at a nearby cafe, I had baklava which came as a large slab unlike the little pieces I normally have!
