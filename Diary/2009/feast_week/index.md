Histon has its
[Feast Week](http://hisimp.com/feast/)
at the middle of the year. The funfair comes and squats on the village green, Virginia is amazed how much they manage to fit on quite a small area. There's a variety of events from the Feast Parade through concerts to hog roasts.

We went to a concert by the
[Moonlight Mandolins](https://www.moonlightmandolins.org/),
an enthusiastic and competent amateur group who played on a variety of instruments including mandolins, lutes, guitars, and mandora. Had tried several times before to see (and hear) them so this was pleasant. Good to do different things, and as I listened I thought it's good to have outlets for one's energies. If I didn't have hobbies I would be a sadder person.

One regular event in Feast Week is the Flower Festival held at the [St Andrews Histon](http://standrewshiston.org/) parish church.
I'd like to think this is a survivor from pagan days, a translation of well dressings and Green Man ceremonies. Probably not. Anyway it gives people a chance to be creative with their displays, and a chance for others to enjoy such displays. There are refreshments to be had, on Saturday there were cream teas, and musical accompaniment too.
