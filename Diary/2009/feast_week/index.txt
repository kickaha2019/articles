	We went to a concert by the

	an enthusiastic and competent amateur group who played on a variety of instruments including mandolins, lutes, guitars, and mandora. Had tried several times before to see (and hear) them so this was pleasant. Good to do different things, and as I listened I thought it's good to have outlets for one's energies. If I didn't have hobbies I would be a sadder person.

	One regular event in Feast Week is the Flower Festival held at the [St Andrews Histon] parish church.
	I'd like to think this is a survivor from pagan days, a translation of well dressings and Green Man ceremonies. Probably not. Anyway it gives people a chance to be creative with their displays, and a chance for others to enjoy such displays. There are refreshments to be had, on Saturday there were cream teas, and musical accompaniment too.
