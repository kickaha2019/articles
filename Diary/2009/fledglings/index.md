Two fledglings were roaming about our back garden, undecided whether flying was something they wanted to do. One was a blackbird, one a starling. They seemed quite unafraid, calling out for food, even jostling a dove. Could have sworn that the same fledgling got fed by both blackbird and starling but perhaps I was wrong.

Virginia kept the cats from having their exercise in the back garden, something they complained about! And they did so want to have a present to give her . . .

Two days later they were gone. Hopefully the absence of feathers means they left under their own steam rather than in the clutches of a marauding beast.
