	which for me is more impressive than Stonehenge. The re-erected stones are ghosts of the past, still making their presence felt as they stand in their circles like petrified cricketeers. Sheep graze in among the stones, a road bisects the circle, the village has squatted on what the site used to be. Yet this monolithic procession still hints at an unseen and unknown, beyond our mundane today. A focus.
