	The keyboard I had been using for practice at home is of limited range, one key is prone to not sounding, and the touch is very light compared with the digital piano I have lessons with Jan Payne on.

	Eventually thinking about getting a better instrument, and talking about a better instrument, have grown into action. I ordered a Roland digital piano from 
	[https://www.millersmusic.co.uk/ Millers] in Cambridge, and it arrived today. Buying was a slightly worrying experience - my credit card vanished for an appreciable time with what I hoped was a salesperson! But the interest free repayments are worth having.

	At first my fingers got tired from the heavier touch. But my teacher says it is definitely helping my hand shape! Despite being a cheaper model it has three pedals, and multiple sounds.

	Virginia may well try her hand or hands at learning piano. Must continue to urge and encourage her!
