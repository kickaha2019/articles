Peter Hewitt ([Mulawa Dreaming](https://mulawa.net)) has been very helpful to me when I was looking at acquiring and manipulating lists of words.  Peter's game
[Cooroora](http://www.mulawa.net/cooroora/index.html) is not the inspiration for "See The World", and I hope my game does not come over as a clone of "Cooroora".

"See The World" contains multiple quotations from a number of great writers: Italo Calvino, Cao Xueqin, Miguel de Cervantes, Arthur C. Clarke, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Herman Melville.  More writers and poets than these are quoted or alluded to.  Source texts for some books were obtained from the [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).  There are a number of allusions and quotations scattered around the game, they are there out of conceit rather than to enhance gameplay.

The images used are either from pictures I've taken, or from images publically available on the web.  So far as I know what I have used is copyright free.
