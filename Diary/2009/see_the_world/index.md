[Tabitha And Amelia See The World](/Users/peter/Sites/Games/SeeTheWorld/php/index.php) is a free browser based game where
the player helps our cats (Tabitha And Amelia) to see a variety of countries
round the globe.  The style of the game is a CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) so very much simpler to the other games I've tried to do.  The aim this time was to manage to complete a game for a change!

The puzzles in this game are word based, similar to those in a crossword.  There isn't a plot to follow, a moral to be drawn, or a prize when and if the end is reached.  There is no sound either in the game, but on each 'page' there is a scene showing one of our cats at a scenic location.

If you like doing crosswords or word puzzles, don't mind a simple presentation, then this game may be for you.
