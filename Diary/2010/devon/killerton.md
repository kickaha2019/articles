We went to see on the Monday
[Killerton House](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/killerton),
an estate which was notable for its owner (a Sir Acland) voluntarily giving it away because he believed such places should be owned communally. Good for him - wouldn't expect that kind of behaviour from even Britain's most socialist MPs. Killerton had a fashion through the ages display upstairs in addition to the usual old books and furniture and pictures.

On Monday we also dropped on to see
[Bicton Park Gardens](http://www.bictongardens.co.uk/)
(busy as it was a Bank Holiday,) and Budleigh Salterton (another seaside town on retirement coast.) Shingle beaches here so don't bother bringing spades and buckets. I do like the patterns randomly made by fishing boats and nets when drawn up out of the sea.
