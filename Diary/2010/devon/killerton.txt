	We went to see on the Monday
	[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/killerton Killerton House],
	an estate which was notable for its owner (a Sir Acland) voluntarily giving it away because he believed such places should be owned communally. Good for him - wouldn't expect that kind of behaviour from even Britain's most socialist MPs. Killerton had a fashion through the ages display upstairs in addition to the usual old books and furniture and pictures.

	On Monday we also dropped on to see 
	[http://www.bictongardens.co.uk/ Bicton Park Gardens]
	(busy as it was a Bank Holiday,) and Budleigh Salterton (another seaside town on retirement coast.) Shingle beaches here so don't bother bringing spades and buckets. I do like the patterns randomly made by fishing boats and nets when drawn up out of the sea.
