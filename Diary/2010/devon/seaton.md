Tuesday took us to
[Forde Abbey](https://www.fordeabbey.co.uk/),
quite a long drive through the country lanes of Devon. Forde Abbey is another stately home, but unlike Killerton still owned by the upper classes. Gardens were purposeful, a builder's van spoiled the front view of the house a bit. They lined up old cars on the lawn as another expression of their nature.

I had more fun riding the
[Seaton tram](https://www.tram.co.uk/)
from Seaton to Colyton and back. The tram followed the sharp angles in the track like a cartoon train. The tram track went over a level crossing and the cars had to stop for us. We had good views of rabbits along the estuary, the driver said he had spotted deer but I couldn't see where he meant. The far end was an old railway station, and we had a tea in the shop there before returning to Seaton.
