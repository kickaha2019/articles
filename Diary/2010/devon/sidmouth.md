Thursday we restricted ourselves to wandering round Sidmouth itself in the rain. Sidmouth had plenty of polling stations, and even UKIP candidates out and about. The Sid river flows through a pleasant park on its way to the sea. Some large established hotels, buildings perched precariously on shored up cliffs, olde worlde tea rooms.

The hosts for the week organised a variety of evening events. Silly games along the lines of pass the parcel - I noted that games are more much fun if you don't mind losing. A waltz or two which Virginia dragged me up out of my seat - easier than I thought to shuffle round in an approximation to the desired dance steps. A dingbat game which I'm no good at really - I might remember that "ON" is "NO GOING BACK" next time. The Sidmouth Songsters sang old-fashioned medleys to us.

We met some good people. A couple on their way back from the Baptist Assembly who knew my sister (my sister knows far too many people.) An elderly lady who was able to advise me on a walk I plan to do in New Zealand late this year. An old gent who could play the organ skilfully even with dementia. Our bodies wear out like trams and houses.
