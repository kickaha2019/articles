My tourism finished with a limited detour up into the Coromandel pensinsula (I did learn that Coromandel is said Coromandle rather than my attempt of Cor-ro-man-del.) As Cathedral Cove was used in the second Narnia film I felt I ought to go and see it. I walked from the carpark near Hahei, but it would have been interesting to do the boat trip. By then I was running out of stamina for more tourism, not only physically but also mentally. Cathedral Cove has very eye catching scenery, a good place to have a picnic and just be. I have trouble just being.

As I explored a little more of New Zealand I also explored the fantasy world of
Deltora books published by [Scholastic](https://www.scholastic.co.uk/).
The books by Emily Rodda was being read by the relatives I visited, and I sped my way through what was to hand. Not bad for what they were - sometimes I muse that somewhere like Deltora is as real as somewhere in the physical world if I can't be there. From the point of view of someone who plays puzzle games the Deltora books are interesting for the number of puzzles in them. On the flight back I also on a whim bought and read
[Maddigan's Quest](https://southpacificpictures.com/productions/details/341/Maddigans-Quest)
by Margaret Mahy. This I did like, will try more by the same authoress.
