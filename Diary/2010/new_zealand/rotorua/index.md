I went to the Rotorua area again for some more fumarole action, this time to the
[Waimangu Volcanic Valley](https://www.waimangu.co.nz/).
My legs were still war wounded after the Alpine Crossing so the steep descents were painful. Waimangu has a very sweet pale blue lake (I'm quite into collecting lakes of different colours.) It also has a very good terrace part of which looks like a giant has been icing a cake. The earth itself bubbles and fumes and puffs here. Happily there was a bus which I caught back up the hill to save my lower limbs!
