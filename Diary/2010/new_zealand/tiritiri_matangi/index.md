Managed to make it to
[Tiritiri Matangi](http://www.tiritirimatangi.org.nz/),
an island nature reserve where imported species like the Pacific rat have been eradicated. In 2006 the weather was too bad for the sea crossing. Pacific rats came with the Maoris rather than the Europeans. The absence of rats means endangered native birds can live in safety, and species like stitchbirds,saddlebacks, tuis, rifleman, NZ robins and NZ pigeons can be easily seen. I didn't need the monoculars which I had brought! Takahe are even a pest round the visitor centre. We were lucky enough to see rarities like the kokako on our good guided tour which was very informative. The island is commonly known as "Tiri" which sounds like "Terry." Besides eradicating pests like the rats, trees have been systematically planets on the island and sugar solutions provided to feed the birds. "Tiri" serves as as a breeding colony from where juvenile birds are relocated to establish colonies elsewhere.
