![Formal gardens](coug_garden.JPG)
Sunday morning we went to
[Stratford Baptist Church](http://www.stratforduponavonbaptist.org.uk/),
nice that so many there spoke to us. Lively music group with some long serving members on the drums and guitars. Hazardous parking in the street, the authorities patrol every hour to see if they can catch offenders parking a minute more than the legal hour.
Is this a modern persecution?

Happily we chose to go to
[Coughton Court](https://www.coughtoncourt.co.uk/)
for a bite to eat, as well as a second dose of Gunpowder plot era Catholicism. The formal gardens are well thought out and worth seeing. The Throckmortons (imposing name) were very involved with Catholic attempts to return England to the Pope's control.

Lastly we did
[Ragley Hall](https://www.ragley.co.uk/),
only to find the house closed for a wedding. They did let us off half the entrance fee which was reasonable. Artwork (depending on how you look at it) is dotted around the estate.
