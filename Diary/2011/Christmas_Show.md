We took Friday 11th off work so we could go to the
[Thursford Christmas Spectacular](https://www.thursford.com/christmas-spectacular/)
at the
[Thursford Collection](https://www.thursford.com/)
in deepest rural Norfolk. Took longer than I expected to get there -
over one and a half hours. We tried out Virginia's Satnav in anger, though
we didn't take its
advice to start with. The Satnav in its female voice kept telling us to turn
round as soon as
possible. As we neared the destination we decided to be friendly and follow
its directives. I got a
little dubious as we started driving along one track lanes and through
farmyards - and when it told us we had arrived there was no sign of our
destination! Happily we were only a few yards away from being able to see
where we hoped to be.

The Thursford Collection (a collection of fairground organs and roundabouts
and steam engines) was heaving with multiple coach parties. The toilets were
oversubscribed, and we had to sit on one of the roundabouts to have a bite
for lunch. Still we were in time for the Christmas Show itself which was
very impressive! An anachronistic spectacular of dance, unalternative
comedian (so funny without being obscene,) Christmas carols, illusionist,
and song and dance numbers. Worth going to. On the way out we tried the
Winter Wonderland exhibit which wasn't quite worth the &pound;4 a head entrance
fee, but was appealing to one's inner child.

We will be booking up to see the show in 2012!

A long drive back, the coaches helped to block the surrounding roads a
little but we got back in one piece.
