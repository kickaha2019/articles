We arrived late in Copenhagen on the Monday due to a power outage on
board ship just before we went through the Kiel Canal. This was the only
real hiccup on the cruise. So instead of the planned excursion we got a
tour of the Copenhagen waterways (very like Amsterdam), a view of the
backside of the Little Mermaid, and 2 hours in the Tivoli Gardens.
Gardens implied to me something in the garden line to look at. We only
found crowds of people, eateries, amusement rides, and flies. Oh by the
entrance there was a shop where you could make a teddy bear to your own
specifications.
