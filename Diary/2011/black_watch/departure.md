Tabitha and Amelia safely stowed in
[Country Cattery](https://www.countrycattery.com/).
Check. Decrepit suitcase repaired with sticky tape. Check.
Passports and tickets in the plastic folder in the laptop bag.
Check. Boiler turned off. Check. Yes it's time for another cruise!
This time with
[Fred Olsen](https://www.fredolsencruises.com/) rather than
[P&O](https://www.pocruises.com/). We were going to go to
the Canary Islands in November, but my Dad decided on one last
holiday to see the Hermitage in St Petersburg. So Virginia and I
also booked on cruise W1111 on the
[Black Watch](https://www.fredolsencruises.com/our-ships/black-watch)
to the Baltics to help him along.

Dad hired friendly talkative Mr Nelson senior to drive us all to
Dover on Saturday July 30th, and to collect us at the end of the
cruise. Both coming and going there were problems at the Dartford
Crossing so not smooth. Mr Nelson collecting us from Dover at 10am
on August 11th didn't work so well as we had been waiting nearly
two hours in poor conditions. That contributed to the flu I went
down with after the cruise. But I'm getting ahead of myself here!

We arrived at Dover Cruise Terminal 1 to find it was an old railway
station! Like stepping back in time, and perhaps cruising is about
stepping back in time, its main attraction. Back to the days when time
moved slower, and there was space for friendliness. A certain amount of
queueing ensued at the cruise terminal, less than at an airport. We were
attacked by the ship's photographers as we boarded the Black Watch as
expected.

Our cases and us both arrived at cabin 5073 on the Main Deck, and we
were ready to sail! Well ready for the first entertainment of the
cruise, the muster with life-jackets. Crew members we would see in other
guises shouted off cabin numbers like jobbers in a stock exchange as
they checked we hadn't lost anyone yet.
