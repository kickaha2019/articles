	I enjoyed the visit to Estonia on Thursday more than Stockholm and Copenhagen. From Tallinn we went to the Lahemaa Forest and Viru Bog. The guide told us about how the USSR ruled Estonia, how Stalin tried to suppress the Estonian language which is close to Finnish, how Stalin took away all the boats lest Estonians flee away by sea, and how Stalin deported Estonian women and children as part of his ethnic planning. The walkways in the Viru Bog were a bit dicey, but the tower offered a good view over the restful peat bog scenes. We had a bite to eat later in a cafe near the sea which had a stuffed owl clutching a stuffed mouse hanging up in one corner of the bar.
