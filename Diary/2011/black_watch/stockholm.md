![The Vasa ship in Stockholm](stock_vasa.JPG)
Next stop was Stockholm where we saw the recovered 300-year old "Vasa" ship which sank on its maiden voyage. The king of the time commanded more guns, so they added an extra gun deck making the ship top-heavy, usual management story. We also went on a tour of old Stockholm, quite crowded. The guide spoke about the troubled history of Sweden, and took us to the square where the Danish King beheaded scores of Swedish aristocrats.
