Our eldest cat Tabitha is now officially 10 years! Officially 10 	years old as we don't know her real birthday so we have to settle 	for when she came into our midst. If the Queen can have an official 	birthday which isn't her real birthday then so can our quean.

Please check out the pictures of how Tabitha celebrated living half her life with us!
