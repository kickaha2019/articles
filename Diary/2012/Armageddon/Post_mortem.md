The questions needed more polishing, I had intended to do crude cartoon animations for the disasters but that was never on, I wasted a lot of time trying to embed SWF files into Flex.  But those weren't the major problem.

*Armageddon* could have worked just as a joke, and even if the disasters you got were totally random and the answers you gave didn't matter.  A joke needing a lot of effort to implement, but still a joke.  Late in the date I decided to add a puzzle to avoid world meltdown.

The trouble with a game with just one puzzle in it is that there's no hook to keep a player interested.  The puzzle was sufficiently hard that some people thought the game was buggy.  So if there's going to be puzzles then start with a really easy one, and build up from there.

I didn't publicise the game very hard.  If you want people to play your games then one must advertise to some extent.  I can focus quite well on making a game, tucked away hidden from the world in my virtual attic, but not at getting out there and telling the world there's something to look at.
