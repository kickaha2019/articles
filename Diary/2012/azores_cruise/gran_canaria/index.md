In Las Palmas rain and fog almost obscured the view of another
caldera.  A lone brave farmer had his farm in the volcano crater,
not where I would live!

We were shown Dragon Trees (Dracaena draco) which are not real
trees but part of the asparagus family.  Their red sap can be used
to stain violins.  Couldn't get into Teror Basilica so instead went
into a Gaudi inspired Church in Ribo Grande.

Sunshine eventually made its presence felt when we went to a banana
plantation hacienda.  Really beautiful with the purple jacaranda
trees.  To help the bananas ripen they wrap the bunches in blue
plastic.
