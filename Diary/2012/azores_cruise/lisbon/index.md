Our final stops were Lisbon then Vigo on the following day.  From
a foggy boat trip we did at least see some monuments and edifices,
then had a coach trip to admire how Lisbon was improved after a
disastrous fire.  Perhaps cities need disasters now and then as
part of their life cycle, to avoid being ossified?  Like nations
benefit from being defeated every now and then to get rid of
deadwood?

We walked into Vigo but didn't understand what they were
demonstrating about as we don't speak Spanish.  Almost came a
cropper as I slipped over at one point in the rain.  We got some
biscuits for gifts at one shop which seemed to be a combination
butchers / wine shop / grocers / sweet shop.  Only to find the
prices on the boat of souvenir biscuits had been cut in half!  Vigo
does have some neat statues which I should have taken pictures of.
