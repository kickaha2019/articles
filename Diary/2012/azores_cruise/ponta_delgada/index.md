Our first ports of call were in the Azores, at Ponta Delgada and 	Horta on the following day.  A cloudy day meant that we saw mist
and fog rather than spectacular lakes in volcanic craters in Ponta
Delgada.  But we did see a pineapple farm where they grew the stuff
in greenhouses, smoking the poor things to make them all ripen at the
same time.
