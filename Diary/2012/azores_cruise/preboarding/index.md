We travelled down on Sunday afternoon and stayed overnight at a
[Holiday Inn Express Southampton M27](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/southampton/soabr/hoteldetail).  This worked well, avoiding any panics
travelling down on the day that the ship left itself.  Dined at a
nearby Pizza Hut and was  revolted to see a bloated Brit woman
licking the serving spoons for the dressings at the salad bar.
Civilisation is skin deep here.

On the Monday we went to
[Mottisfont](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/mottisfont)
where socialite / art lover Maud Russell used to live.
The name Mottisfont may be derived from
'Moot' and 'Font' (or spring which is still going strong.)  The
house contains a number of illusions like a bookcase which is
really a door, a flat wall which seems to bend, paint pots which
are part of the painting.  We all play games, different games.
