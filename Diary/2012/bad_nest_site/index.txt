Title:
	Not a good site for a nest

Date:
	7 April 2012

Text:
	A blackbird decided to build a nest in the narrow gap between our
	cat enclosure and the neighbour's sun lounge.  As it built it on
	a window ledge the nest kept collapsing.  Despite that the
	blackbird and its mate have persisted.  Our cats have expressed
	great interest in the proceedings.
