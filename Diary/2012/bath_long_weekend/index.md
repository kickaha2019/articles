The [Albany Guest House](https://www.albanybath.co.uk/) was easy to get to thanks to the Satnav.
Less sure about getting to the car park behind the guest house
which was two spaces in what had been a sloping garden.
Our car got blocked in at one stage and I thought we might
have longer in Bath than originally planned!  Parking in Bath
is expensive, the municipal car park above us on the hill cost
an arm and a leg.  But we were well within walking distance
of the centre of Bath.

Our room wasn't ensuite so we got a bunch of three keys - took
a day to take the guessing out of finding the right key.  The
front door key had to be turned clockwise!  Apart from the
nuisance of the bathroom being separate it was fine, the
downstairs breakfast area was nice and the cooked breakfast
set one up for a day's exploring.

Bath feels like it hasn't changed much since Jane Austen's days,
perhaps our guest house was around then?  Perhaps it was, but
free wi-fi certainly wasn't.  The iPad proved useful for
checking Facebook as well as keeping a diary as the days
happened.  I also read "Kidnapped" and its sequel "Catriona"
on it in the evenings.

The guest house kindly armed us with maps and guides and we set
off for the
[Roman baths](https://www.romanbaths.co.uk/) on the Friday afternoon.

The presentation of the hot springs of Aqua Sulis has changed over
the years.  The displays and audio-guide did a good job of trying
to suggest what the Roman baths were like for the Romans.  They
were very organised people, it was a big enterprise and had a
haruspex augurer to boot.  The displays displayed all the buildings
and detailed the various baths and rooms and temples.  But
like many things knowing is not enough, it's short of
experiencing for oneself believing for oneself.

The water still bubbles up, steam drifts over the
carved stones, statues look on.  One could say the spirit of
the spring is still worshipped.  There's a Thermae Bath Spa
which promises its adherents health as much as Sulis Minerva
promised her adherents health.  A kind of worship though we
don't use that term.  We're not so different to the ancient
Celts who first knew the hot springs.

Friday supper was a disaster.  What I hoped for was a traditional
pub restaurant, relaxed dining amid oak beams.  What I found I had
picked was nouvelle cuisine (the colours and shapes outweigh the
nutritional value) and abysmally laid out tables where it was hard
to tell which table I was sitting at.  So avoid anything
saying modern English.

On the Saturday we found Bath receiving a flood of tourists
disgorged from coaches.  The younger element seemed content to
relax in the grassy park below the Royal Crescent rather than
indulge in tourism.  Probably the
[Jane Austen Center](https://www.janeausten.co.uk/) had less appeal to them than it did to
us.  We learnt about Jane Austen's time in Bath, how her
father dying meant they had to move to less and less salubrious
areas of town.  All grist for her writing mill.

We had tea and muffins in the sweet Regency tea-rooms
upstairs, genteel!  They were kind to replace the toasted bun I
ordered forgetting it would contain raisins with a cheese scone.

We saw a missable fashion display at the
[Assembly Rooms](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/bath-assembly-rooms)
but not the Assembly Rooms themselves as a Book Fair was in
full swing.  More rewarding was a trip to
[No 1 The Royal Crescent](https://www.bath-preservation-trust.org.uk/?id=3)
in the splendid Royal Crescent
and Circus areas of Bath.  No 1 had a Georgian kitchen with
intricate mousetraps.  It also taught me that drawing rooms
are drawing rooms because ladies withdrew to them.  I also
learnt what a girondelle is (mirror with attached candles
to light a room.)  One learns something each and every day.

A quiet pleasant boat trip to Bathampton Weir and back
crowned the afternoon.  We didn't run down too many rowing
boats on the Avon.  Bath was heaving badly and we struggled to find
to find somewhere for afternoon tea.  Our evening meal was
at the
[Pizza Express Bath Theatre Royal](https://www.pizzaexpress.com/bath-theatre-royal)
which suited me better than nouvelle cuisine.

On the Sunday we dropped in on [Dyrham Park](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dyrham-park) stupidly
trusting the National Trust recommended postcode for the
Satnav.  Mistake, went down one-track road only to find
a keep out sign.  Another mistake of the National Trust
was the modern art randomly littered round the stately home.
Art is putting it a bit strong.  Dyrham Park itself had
some good views, we hadn't seen it, but it is another
stately home.
