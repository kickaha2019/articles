	The [https://www.albanybath.co.uk/ Albany Guest House] was easy to get to thanks to the Satnav.
	Less sure about getting to the car park behind the guest house
	which was two spaces in what had been a sloping garden.
	Our car got blocked in at one stage and I thought we might
	have longer in Bath than originally planned!  Parking in Bath
	is expensive, the municipal car park above us on the hill cost
	an arm and a leg.  But we were well within walking distance 
	of the centre of Bath.

	Our room wasn't ensuite so we got a bunch of three keys - took
	a day to take the guessing out of finding the right key.  The
	front door key had to be turned clockwise!  Apart from the
	nuisance of the bathroom being separate it was fine, the 
	downstairs breakfast area was nice and the cooked breakfast
	set one up for a day's exploring.
	
	Bath feels like it hasn't changed much since Jane Austen's days,
	perhaps our guest house was around then?  Perhaps it was, but
	free wi-fi certainly wasn't.  The iPad proved useful for
	checking Facebook as well as keeping a diary as the days
	happened.  I also read "Kidnapped" and its sequel "Catriona"
	on it in the evenings.

	The guest house kindly armed us with maps and guides and we set 
	off for the 
	[https://www.romanbaths.co.uk/ Roman baths] on the Friday afternoon.
	
	The presentation of the hot springs of Aqua Sulis has changed over
	the years.  The displays and audio-guide did a good job of trying
	to suggest what the Roman baths were like for the Romans.  They
	were very organised people, it was a big enterprise and had a
	haruspex augurer to boot.  The displays displayed all the buildings
	and detailed the various baths and rooms and temples.  But
	like many things knowing is not enough, it's short of
	experiencing for oneself believing for oneself.

	The water still bubbles up, steam drifts over the
	carved stones, statues look on.  One could say the spirit of
	the spring is still worshipped.  There's a Thermae Bath Spa 
	which promises its adherents health as much as Sulis Minerva
	promised her adherents health.  A kind of worship though we
	don't use that term.  We're not so different to the ancient
	Celts who first knew the hot springs.
	
	Friday supper was a disaster.  What I hoped for was a traditional
	pub restaurant, relaxed dining amid oak beams.  What I found I had
	picked was nouvelle cuisine (the colours and shapes outweigh the
	nutritional value) and abysmally laid out tables where it was hard
	to tell which table I was sitting at.  So avoid anything
	saying modern English.
	
	On the Saturday we found Bath receiving a flood of tourists
	disgorged from coaches.  The younger element seemed content to
	relax in the grassy park below the Royal Crescent rather than
	indulge in tourism.  Probably the 
	[https://www.janeausten.co.uk/ Jane Austen Center] had less appeal to them than it did to
	us.  We learnt about Jane Austen's time in Bath, how her
	father dying meant they had to move to less and less salubrious
	areas of town.  All grist for her writing mill.

	We had tea and muffins in the sweet Regency tea-rooms
	upstairs, genteel!  They were kind to replace the toasted bun I
	ordered forgetting it would contain raisins with a cheese scone.
	
	We saw a missable fashion display at the 
	[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/bath-assembly-rooms Assembly Rooms]
	but not the Assembly Rooms themselves as a Book Fair was in
	full swing.  More rewarding was a trip to 
	[https://www.bath-preservation-trust.org.uk/?id=3 No 1 The Royal Crescent] 
	in the splendid Royal Crescent
	and Circus areas of Bath.  No 1 had a Georgian kitchen with
	intricate mousetraps.  It also taught me that drawing rooms
	are drawing rooms because ladies withdrew to them.  I also
	learnt what a girondelle is (mirror with attached candles
	to light a room.)  One learns something each and every day.

	A quiet pleasant boat trip to Bathampton Weir and back
	crowned the afternoon.  We didn't run down too many rowing
	boats on the Avon.  Bath was heaving badly and we struggled to find
	to find somewhere for afternoon tea.  Our evening meal was 
	at the
	[Pizza Express Bath Theatre Royal]
	which suited me better than nouvelle cuisine.

	On the Sunday we dropped in on [https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dyrham-park Dyrham Park] stupidly
	trusting the National Trust recommended postcode for the 
	Satnav.  Mistake, went down one-track road only to find
	a keep out sign.  Another mistake of the National Trust
	was the modern art randomly littered round the stately home.
	Art is putting it a bit strong.  Dyrham Park itself had
	some good views, we hadn't seen it, but it is another
	stately home.
