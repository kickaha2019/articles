Leaving the cats in charge of the homestead we drove up the A14
to Derbyshire.  We stopped at the
[Little Chef](http://www.littlechef.co.uk/) Kettering West
for lunch, which had been refurbished in red
and white.  The ceiling was covered in blue and white square tiles,
each square a fragment of a cloudy sky, but the squares had
been randomly placed.  A jigsaw waiting to be done.  I had
an American breakfast which according to Little Chef is
scrambled eggs, bacon, and pancakes with mapleen syrup.
Virginia had a steak pie then realised we were due for a
three course meal in the evening.

With the aid of the Satnav we found our way to
[Denby pottery](https://www.denbypottery.com/denby-pottery-village),
where we got some more Azure which is the
line Virginia has been collecting.  Downstairs in the
factory shop rather than the showroom upstairs.  I
admired the various displays as if they were exhibits in
an art exhibition.

The Satnav got us pretty close to
[Willersley Castle](https://www.christianguild.co.uk/willersley/)
where we were staying, but for the
last few hundred yards we had to rely on our memories of
where it was last time we visited, as the Satnav directed us to
a shut gate in front of a meadow.  Willersley Castle has
plenty of character but our room wasn't ensuite, just as
well it was only for two nights.  We did know that when we
booked so having the bathroom and toilet a corridor away was
our fault.  What we didn't know was our long weekend
coincided with a Church away weekend, and our room was
right over the big room they were using.  So the evening
wasn't relaxing until they had finished.  (Memo to self: do not
stay in rooms 1 through 4 at Willersley Castle ever again.)

We beat them by minutes to breakfast on the Saturday.  The
teenage girls came down in their pyjamas to add a certain
ambience to proceedings.  We paid a deposit of &pound;5 for a
magic key and set off for Matlock Bath along a walking track
made treacherous with a covering of leaf mulch.  A pleasant
stroll, more pleasant than taking the car, and better
exercise.  We went along Lovers Walk then crossed a bridge
into
[Matlock Bath](http://www.visitmatlockbath.co.uk/)
proper.  Which was definitely end of
season, most places shut up, cafes with chairs on tables
and lights off.

Virginia suggested we try the
[Aquarium](http://www.matlockbathaquarium.co.uk/)
which had foreign fish imprisoned in tanks, a 'well' displaying
the calcifying effects of the thermal spring Matlock Bath is
named for, a range of carp that Virginia fed for 50p, and
nautical knots.  Worth a visit.  We also wandered up to
[Masson Mills](https://www.massonmills.co.uk/)
where I got my picture taken with Santa Claus
and Richard Awkwright, then on the way back had a nice stop
at a cafe at [Cromford Mill](http://www.cromfordmill.co.uk/),
I was tempted by the coffee and walnut
but went for the lemon drizzle.

The sweet side of staying at the
[Christian Guild](https://www.christianguild.co.uk/)
hotels like Willersley Castle for me is
meeting people.  So we had two pleasant evening meals on
tables for eight, and a chat about books in the TV lounge (the
TV was mercifully off).  That is sweet indeed in this age where
people are so insulated from each other, people will talk to
someone on the other side of the world but ignore the person
they're standing next to.
