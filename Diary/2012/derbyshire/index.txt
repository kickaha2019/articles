	Derbyshire long weekend

	Leaving the cats in charge of the homestead we drove up the A14
	to Derbyshire.  We stopped at the 
	[http://www.littlechef.co.uk/ Little Chef] Kettering West
	for lunch, which had been refurbished in red
	and white.  The ceiling was covered in blue and white square tiles,
	each square a fragment of a cloudy sky, but the squares had 
	been randomly placed.  A jigsaw waiting to be done.  I had
	an American breakfast which according to Little Chef is
	scrambled eggs, bacon, and pancakes with mapleen syrup.
	Virginia had a steak pie then realised we were due for a
	three course meal in the evening.

	With the aid of the Satnav we found our way to 
	[https://www.denbypottery.com/denby-pottery-village Denby pottery],
	where we got some more Azure which is the
	line Virginia has been collecting.  Downstairs in the
	factory shop rather than the showroom upstairs.  I
	admired the various displays as if they were exhibits in
	an art exhibition.

	The Satnav got us pretty close to
	[https://www.christianguild.co.uk/willersley/ Willersley Castle]
	where we were staying, but for the
	last few hundred yards we had to rely on our memories of
	where it was last time we visited, as the Satnav directed us to
	a shut gate in front of a meadow.  Willersley Castle has
	plenty of character but our room wasn't ensuite, just as
	well it was only for two nights.  We did know that when we
	booked so having the bathroom and toilet a corridor away was
	our fault.  What we didn't know was our long weekend 
	coincided with a Church away weekend, and our room was
	right over the big room they were using.  So the evening
	wasn't relaxing until they had finished.  (Memo to self: do not
	stay in rooms 1 through 4 at Willersley Castle ever again.)

	We beat them by minutes to breakfast on the Saturday.  The
	teenage girls came down in their pyjamas to add a certain
	ambience to proceedings.  We paid a deposit of &pound;5 for a
	magic key and set off for Matlock Bath along a walking track
	made treacherous with a covering of leaf mulch.  A pleasant
	stroll, more pleasant than taking the car, and better
	exercise.  We went along Lovers Walk then crossed a bridge
	into 
	[http://www.visitmatlockbath.co.uk/ Matlock Bath] 
	proper.  Which was definitely end of
	season, most places shut up, cafes with chairs on tables
	and lights off.

	Virginia suggested we try the 
	[http://www.matlockbathaquarium.co.uk/ Aquarium]
	which had foreign fish imprisoned in tanks, a 'well' displaying
	the calcifying effects of the thermal spring Matlock Bath is
	named for, a range of carp that Virginia fed for 50p, and
	nautical knots.  Worth a visit.  We also wandered up to
	[https://www.massonmills.co.uk/ Masson Mills]
	where I got my picture taken with Santa Claus
	and Richard Awkwright, then on the way back had a nice stop
	at a cafe at [http://www.cromfordmill.co.uk/ Cromford Mill], 
	I was tempted by the coffee and walnut
	but went for the lemon drizzle.
	
	The sweet side of staying at the 
	[https://www.christianguild.co.uk/ Christian Guild] 
	hotels like Willersley Castle for me is
	meeting people.  So we had two pleasant evening meals on
	tables for eight, and a chat about books in the TV lounge (the
	TV was mercifully off).  That is sweet indeed in this age where
	people are so insulated from each other, people will talk to
	someone on the other side of the world but ignore the person
	they're standing next to.
