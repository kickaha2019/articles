The home computer is now one of the new iMacs.  A rather expensive
Christmas present to myself!

The Mountain Lion has certainly pounced, some noticeable differences
to Snow Leopard!

It's rather like moving house.  The applications like rooms are
not a one-to-one mapping.  I need to adjust to the way the new OS
(to me) is best suited to.  An example - Calendar no longer
offers the chance to say repeat this reminder in a day or a
week.  Instead you can either dismiss it, or be reminded again
in fifteen minutes.  So I'm looking at Reminders as an alternative
way of managing tasks to be done.
