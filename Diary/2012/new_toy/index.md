I now have an iPad, I've joined the ranks of tablet owners.  My problem now is to justify having it!

One justification is that it's a good thing to take on holiday.  I've already loaded nearly 200 books onto it which will last me several holidays even at the rate I read.  And I can keep in touch using email and the web through it.

Even at home it eases pressure on who's using the computer.  For just checking email / Facebook the iPad is very usable.

And when we're playing games and get stuck no need to fell forests printing off walkthroughs, one can look at them on the iPad!
