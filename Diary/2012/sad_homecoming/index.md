Virginia and I returned from a cruise to the Azores on the 9th of June to find my mother very poorly.  On Sunday we went to the care home she was in, and heart-breakingly watched her pass away.

Rationally she's gone.  The room at the care home is now empty.  There's a death certificate with her name on it.  She had a good innings you can say.  We got back in time you can say.

Emotionally she's still part of me, and I'm part of her.  Emotionally it hurts a lot.  Grief grieves me.  It should hurt, otherwise I'm just a biochemical robot.
