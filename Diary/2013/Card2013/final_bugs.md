Sometimes a click would result in two click events, and
if this happened when finding a soft toy the image of
the found soft toy would vanish too quickly.  Fixed
in a quick fashion.

Sometimes the hint meter would get drawn in the wrong place.
Fixed by ensuring all screen elements have a top and left
set in their styles.  I've hit this one before!
