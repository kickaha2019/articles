[Jacquie Lawson](https://www.jacquielawson.com) does these marvellous
E-cards which were a pleasant discovery when I was first sent one.
Crossing that with a computer game seemed worth trying.

Virginia and I sometimes create paper chases round the house on
birthdays and the like.  Children know how to have fun where adults
have forgotten.  Doing something similar but on the computer
appealed to me.

I'm also trying to learn from my previous attempts at game-making
by making something more accessible.  The short time to produce
the finished game will focus the mind wonderfully.
