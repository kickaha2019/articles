	One of Armageddon's faults was slow initial loading of the first
	screen.  To get to the first screen the browser has to load the
	Javascript code which was in one .js file.  

	An improvement for ''Card 2013'' is to split up the Javascript
	code into separate files, and load the code for a particular
	scene on the first time it is needed.  This isn't so required
	for ''Card 2013'' as it is a smaller game, but seemed a
	worthwhile change to make.

	The loading is done using [https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp Ajax].
	It is done synchronously which is not usually recommended, but
	in this specific instance made life simpler.
