	The latest build is available at [/Users/peter/Sites/Games/Journeys/build/index.html Journeys].

	''Build 9'': Avoided displaying incomplete images by using image load
	callbacks.  Fixed minor issues like game forgetting progress on a
	manual refresh.

	''Build 8'': Split main menu into two, the second for when playing the
	game after user feedback.  Made the tour slideshow simpler after
	feedback.

	''Build 7'': Rework of the menus and buttons. Issues on some browsers
	addressed.  This may be the final version.

	''Build 6'': All puzzles now implemented.  Automated tests 
	implemented (see ''Testing'').
	
	''Build 5'': A simple puzzle is now available.

	''Build 4'': Tours can now be taken.

	''Build 3'': There are now deck plans to be seen.  Cursor detection
	now uses the mouse move event with Javascript.

	''Build 2'': There is now a screen from which the deck plans can
	be reached (or could be reached if the deck plans had been done
	yet.)
