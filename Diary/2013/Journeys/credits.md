I have been lucky enough to have a number of people looking at
"Journeys" as it evolved.  Their feedback has been very valuable
in improving the game to its final state.  I've learnt from
what they have had to say.

From [Mystery Manor](http://www.mysterymanor.net/forum/) I'd like to
thank Winfrey, Draclvr, Rosaboobie, and Lady Kestrel.

From *Adventure Developers*
I'd like to thank Ad7venture, Nigec, and Imari.
