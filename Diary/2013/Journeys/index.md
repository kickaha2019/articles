"Journeys" is a game based on pictures of the P&O cruise ship
"Oriana" taken during a
[cruise to the Azores](https://alofmethbin.com/Articles/Diary/2012/azores_cruise/index.html)
in May / June 2012.
The game will have a number of slideshows of journeys round the
Oriana unlocked by solving puzzles.

I had started doing a virtual tour of the "Black Watch" which
we took a
[cruise to the Baltics](https://alofmethbin.com/Articles/Diary/2011/black_watch/index.html)
on in 2011.  However I felt
the geometry of a cruise ship does not lend itself to representing
the ship as a set of locations, at which you can pan around or
move to neighbouring nodes.  Too many places on a cruise ship are
narrow long passages for that to work.  I felt.

So instead I went for showing the ship by a number of journeys
round it.  There are puzzles to unlock the journeys, but
only if you want puzzles.

The game is playable in most modern browsers, but doesn't
have sound.
