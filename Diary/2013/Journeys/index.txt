	"Journeys" is a game based on pictures of the P&O cruise ship
	"Oriana" taken during a 
	[/Users/peter/Sites/Articles/Diary/2012/azores_cruise/index.html cruise to the Azores]
	in May / June 2012.
	The game will have a number of slideshows of journeys round the
	Oriana unlocked by solving puzzles.
	
	I had started doing a virtual tour of the "Black Watch" which
	we took a 
	[/Users/peter/Sites/Articles/Diary/2011/black_watch/index.html cruise to the Baltics]
	on in 2011.  However I felt
	the geometry of a cruise ship does not lend itself to representing
	the ship as a set of locations, at which you can pan around or
	move to neighbouring nodes.  Too many places on a cruise ship are
	narrow long passages for that to work.  I felt.
	
	So instead I went for showing the ship by a number of journeys
	round it.  There are puzzles to unlock the journeys, but
	only if you want puzzles.

	The game is playable in most modern browsers, but doesn't 
	have sound.
