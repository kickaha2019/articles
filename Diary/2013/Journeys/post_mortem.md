"Journeys" has been another learning experience, learning of
what not to do.  Even changes I've made to improve the
game for players have turned out to be unwise.  Towards the
end I changed the symbols on the computer in the game from cryptic
Oriental squiggles to being Arabic numerals and meaningful
signs.  But doing that has confused matters even more, it's
not visibly clear what state the computer is in any more.

The computer and deriving cabin numbers from the keys one
finds is too separated from the scenes in the game.  The deck
layout is fiddly and unfriendly.

And I started with such high hopes of making a decent game
for once!
