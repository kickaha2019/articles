	Virginia and I together with her parents hired a boat from 
	[https://www.richardsonsboatingholidays.co.uk/ Richardsons] in Acle
	to do a one week cruise on the Norfolk Broads in late May.
	The helpful people at the 
	now closed ''Horizon boatyard''
	gave us a crash course in handling the boat then sent us on our way.
	The professionals made it all look easy from steering the boat to 
	mooring it - but such skills need longer than a week to acquire.

	Our boat 
	[https://www.richardsonsboatingholidays.co.uk/boats/golden-horizon/ Golden Horizon 2]
	wasn't as glamorous or as big as some of the boats we met but served us.
	It was quite noisy inside as when the water pump ran, or when 
	water was slapping not lapping against the keel as at our first stop
	[https://www.norfarchtrust.org.uk/stbenets St Benet's Abbey], or when
	torrential rain beat down as it did during our holiday.	 The good
	weather only came when we had finished our cruise!  The either frigid
	or scalding showers on
	the boat made noises like a dentist's drills.  It was eerie and
	wrong when the boat wasn't noisy.

	We only used the mudweight once on the cruise when we stern moored - the
	weight was too heavy for me to lift alone.  The stern mooring ropes were
	meant to be left lying along the sides of the boat, once we didn't do this
	and panic ensued when we moored.  Each day started with checking the
	engine - the crew took out the dipstick to check the oil level then 
	couldn't find where to put it back.  Each day we also topped up with
	drinking water, the first time took ages as we didn't notice it coming
	out the overflow!  The inverter used to power the TV could be used to
	recharge phones and iPads, but nothing more powerful.  The boat had
	a new gas oven but it was little more than a camp stove.

	The Norfolk Broads are a very beautiful and serene landscape, especially
	when you cruise along reed lined avenues of water at walking pace.  It's
	flat yes but you get huge expanses of sky.  We saw grebes and magical
	blue kingfishers and nesting swans and herons - ducks clambered all over
	the boat as it suited them.  Drainage pumps of different eras were
	scattered around like the remains of dinosaurs.

	We wandered to a few places as tourists.  There wasn't a lot to see
	at [St Benet's Abbey] itself.  
	[http://howhilltrust.org.uk/toad-hole-cottage-museum/ Toad Hole Cottage]
	was worth a look as a look into the past.  We got a mug from
	[https://www.suttonpottery.com Sutton Pottery] and chatted to the genial
	potter there.  We almost saw a candle making place at 
	[https://www.stokesby.org.uk Stokesby] but it had moved!  The
	[https://www.stokesby.org.uk/riverside-stores Tea Rooms] did
	a great cheese and onion toastie though.

	The holiday was rather stressful as a whole.  There was stress
	about finding moorings.  There was stress about maintaining the
	boat like keeping the drinking water topped up.  There was big stress
	manoeuvring the boat.  Forward is fun enough with the delay before
	turning the wheel does anything combined with the wind and tide
	affecting where you go.  I found reversing nigh impossible with not
	being able to see where the boat was going combined with the crew
	panicking about hitting things like other boats.  There were those
	skilled at handling such boats, who knew how to use the fact a boat is
	very different to a car.  You can pivot a boat on a spot which you
	can't with a car.

	Most of the people we met were very helpful, aiding us by taking our
	mooring lines and tying up for us making it look like second nature.
	A few of the people we
	encountered in boats were not so welcome.  The lot who didn't
	appreciate to moor a boat you need a space at least as large as
	the boat you're trying to moor.  The couple on a sailing yacht who
	crashed into boats as they tacked from side to side without
	caring or apologising.  

	At the moment I don't feel like having another Broads cruise holiday.
