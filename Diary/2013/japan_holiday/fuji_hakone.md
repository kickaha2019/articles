This would have been Mum's birthday.  I could have told her of
how I was doing in Japan, of how appreciative I was for all she
did for me.

Checked out of the Tokyo hotel after an even busier scrum for
breakfast, case loaded onto the coach for the
normal tour of hotels before the real tour begins.  Our guide
on this wet morning was the bubbly Keiko, who has a one-hour
commute to work.  The guides and drivers must really put in the
hours, and the guides must be like actors each performance
saying the same lines.  Left the high-rise newness of Tokyo
and travelled through older style flatness of rural Japan,
noticing again the cramped graveyards where families share
the gravestone.

I was glad two voluble US servicemen left for another tour
bus (in foreign lands I'm embarrassed almost to be with other
foreigners!) but we gained new tour members who shot hundreds
of pictures with expensive cameras as the coach drove along.  I've
never got good results doing that.  If people around me are
talking in English I can't ignore what they're saying, but
if they talk in Hungarian or Basque it's just background noise.

As we approached Mount Fuji fog reduced visibility, and then as the coach
ascended upwards snow flurries started.  It was a white-out as
far as we could go.  Snow was lying around Station 5.  By a
happy chance the weather cleared enough for us to see the summit,
not as impressive as seeing the mountain from further away on a
clear day.

Keiko demonstrated a 12-step Japanese puzzle box on the way to
Hakone, and I was so taken by this I bought one at a souvenir
shop.  Puzzles fascinate me, though I'm not always good at
solving them!  In Hakone we had a cable car over Owakudani
crater but saw fog in every direction rather volcanic activity
beneath.  They boil eggs in the hot springs there, and the
sulphur content blackens the eggs.  Not sure I would eat the
result.

Keiko then got us onto the last [Hankone Pirate Cruise](https://www.hakone-kankosen.co.jp/foreign/en/index.php) (she like the other
guides kept thanking us for punctuality with bows when in fact some people held
up coach departure by ten or so minutes).  Pirates aren't what
they used to judge by the young Japanese girl clad piratically
who was smiling and posing rather making annoying tourists walk
the plank.  Keiko then taught us 1 through 10 in Japanese (ichi
ni san shi go rock hitch hatch queue jui(ce)) and thus prepared
dropped us off in Owadara to experience the Shinkansen or bullet
train to get to Kyoto.  Burt and Priscilla and I killed some time
by visiting a local 'tea room' which was on the rural side.  Burt's
cup of tea came with a toy thimble of milk which was smaller than
the container of syrup I had with the pancakes.

![Trains including the bullet train in Japan run to time](p46_train.JPG)
More time was killed before we ventured onto the platform.  The
bullet trains really whizz pass, not enough time for me to get a camera
out and be ready to snap!  Travelling with a large case only just worked,
there is more leg room than on most trains in the reserved carriages.
I don't think I could have got the main case up into the luggage rack,
but I only noticed the luggage rack much later!  (Some carriages have unreserved
seats.)  The platforms are very organised with big Ls marked for
queues to form.  The trains meticuously stop so you can line up
exactly to wait to board.  There are facilities on board including
a hostess who wheeled a refreshment trolley through the carriage,
bowing as she left as if to apologise.  The bullet trains are
very stylish from the outside, the ride is pleasant enough and
scenery speeds by at 200 to 300 kilometres per hour.

On reaching Kyoto I had a slight wander to find the Karasuma
metro line late at night, and then struggled to find the entrance
to the [Karasuma Kyoto Hotel](https://www.hotel.kyoto.e.adw.hp.transer.com/karasuma/) - it was obscured by a Starbucks
in the same building.  My Kyoto hotel felt like a youth hostel
after the Tokyo luxury - the lobby being patronised by westerners
didn't help.  My single room is rather cramped, bearing in mind
our pet cats I won't make the normal comparison.
