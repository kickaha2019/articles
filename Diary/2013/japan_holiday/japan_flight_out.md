I decided to get to [London City Airport](https://www.londoncityairport.com) early, and have
breakfast there.  Discovered I was far too early so I had
a bowl of porridge with a dollop of honey.  The place I
patronised was out of spoons which made life interesting.
I had also discovered I had left the luggage tags behind, and
if I had been sensible I would have taken the Euros I had
for when I transitted Amsterdam and Paris.  Silly me.

Only minor hiccup was the Oyster card flashed red when I tried
to swipe but it proved to be I was out of credit, and the
machines worked well so I could top it painlessly.

London City Airport proved to be an oasis of peace and
quiet compared with Heathrow.  Plenty of seats to sit in,
no queues.  I bought a Telegraph as it came with a free
bottle of water, then left the unwanted newspaper behind.

Two crosswords later (both of which Mum had started long ago)
I reached [Schipol](https://www.schiphol.nl/en/) airport.  The CityJet flight was tricky to stow
one's luggage - a lot of the overhead compartments were
half-height.  They served drink and snacks which I wasn't
expecting.  At Amsterdam I treated myself to a bowl of
Japanese style udon soy sakai (vegetable) noodles to get
acclimatised.  For this purpose egg is a vegetable judging by
it appearing in my bowl.

In Amsterdam they stop you taking bottles of water on board
the plane.  However I discovered they're happy for you to
take an empty bottle and fill it from a convenient water
fountain inside the holding pen for passengers to be
boarded.  I thought that was a good omen - it wasn't.  We
were an hour and a half late taking off due to a starter
motor failing on an engine.  I found myself rather too
close to a family with young children.  Sleep was at a
premium.

I missed out on the Japanese style meal and instead had
the Hobson's choice of pallid pasta which gave me an upset
stomach to begin the holiday with.  One Japanese dame managed
to throw the contents of a cup of water my way.  Breakfast
was inedible - why do people think yoghurt is good for you?
