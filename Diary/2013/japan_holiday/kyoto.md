ikio Yomoda a volunteer [Goodwill Guide](https://www.japan.travel/en/plan/list-of-volunteer-guides/) kindly helped me
see a number of places in Kyoto today.  Without his help I
wouldn't haved dared enter a bus for fear of ending up I knew
not where!  Talking of the buses they're opposite to buses in the
UK - you enter them at the back, and pay on exit!  The buses like
the trains in Tokyo do have announcements in English.  In
fact the Kyoto buses have touristy commentaries on them!

We first saw [Ryoanji](http://www.ryoanji.jp/smph/eng/) which my father particularly wanted me
to see.  Ryoanji has a very famous sand Zen garden which one
could meditate at for hours.  I did get a spiritual impression from
it, the soul set free.  I tried to ask my guide if Ryoanji was
still a proper temple with monks or just a tourist attraction,
never made myself well enough understood.  Nearby was a place
where they made stone lanterns for temples and other very un-Japanese
looking statuary.

![Silver Pavilion](p82_silver.JPG)
I was despondent to learn that Nijo Castle just means 2nd Street
Castle - how unromantic.  I also learnt that the "mi" component
of many girl's names is the Chinese "mei" character for beautiful.
We then went to the [Silver Pavilion](http://www.shokoku-ji.jp/g_about.html)
which has a pavilion like the [Golden Pavilion](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1152) save it's not covered
with gold or silver.  The feudal lord's wife put her foot down.  The
[Silver Pavilion](http://www.shokoku-ji.jp/g_about.html) has a Zen sand garden too, but very different to
Ryoanji, almost modern artish.  A map of Kyoto has many swastikas on it marking
the temples.  The swastika has a long history even before it became
associated with Buddha.

We had a slight detour to Mikio's friend cafe.  Now Mikio had asked
if I would be tired of Japanese food, which I took to mean him asking
if I minded Japanese food again.  Mikio's actual meaning was that his
friend served Western style food!  But it was a good visit - his friend
played a tape of Japanese operatic singing she taught.  She also
folded origami, and forced me to take some models she had folded
after learning my father paper-folded.  I was embarrassed by this, and by
Mikio's generosity.  I had only brought biscuits from the UK as
presentos, how cheap.  Mikio had coffee there, and got a tiny thimble
of milk like Burt did.  Apparently that's the way Japanese take
coffee!

We then took the [Philosopher's Walk](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3906.html), which was very beautiful with
trees in blossom.  At one place people were gaga over a gathering of
cats, a feline knows how to twist a human around its little claw.
The Walk wasn't as meditative as when the philosopher walked it,
houses and shops now intrude, bicyclists hurtle along, tourists
snap away as they collect another tourist spot for the record.

We strolled some way to the Kyoto Handicraft Shop, where I spent
some money on presents.  Certainly cheaper elsewhere but you might
spend time finding a bargain.  The shop did take some tax off, and
I got a pair of chopsticks and postcards as a free bonus.  I had
asked Mikio to take me to the [Heian Shrine](http://www.heianjingu.or.jp/), but I was
beginning to be saturated with seeing temples and castles.  So instead
we headed for the [Nishiki Food Street](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3931.html)!

![Nishiki Food Market shop in Kyoto](p89_food.JPG)
This is a long long covered arcade of food stalls.  Not just food.
An assault of colours and shapes and tastes!  Mikio treated me to
a sticky syrupy dessert but we had to wait until we reached a department
store to find a bin to put the messy wrappers in!

In the evening I walked in the light rain to [Gion Corner](http://www.kyoto-gioncorner.com/global/en.html) in the
the geisha quarter.  Strange mix of the rich Japanese after their
traditional entertainment, and tourists after the salacious.  The
show at Gion Corner was aimed at tourists who gawped and snapped
and laughed at how strange it was.  The actual bunraku and kyogen
and maiko dancing deserved better, deserved more discerning an
audience.  The Chinese label the Japanese as "Tang", certainly
many of these arts and Buddhism in Japan came from the Tang
dynasty in China.

A confession.  My supper this evening was a Macdonalds.  I just
needed the reassurance of my own tongue.  Guilty.
