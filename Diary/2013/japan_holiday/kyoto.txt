    Mikio Yomoda a volunteer [https://www.japan.travel/en/plan/list-of-volunteer-guides/ Goodwill Guide] kindly helped me
    see a number of places in Kyoto today.  Without his help I 
    wouldn't haved dared enter a bus for fear of ending up I knew
    not where!  Talking of the buses they're opposite to buses in the
    UK - you enter them at the back, and pay on exit!  The buses like
    the trains in Tokyo do have announcements in English.  In 
    fact the Kyoto buses have touristy commentaries on them!

    We first saw [http://www.ryoanji.jp/smph/eng/ Ryoanji] which my father particularly wanted me
    to see.  Ryoanji has a very famous sand Zen garden which one
    could meditate at for hours.  I did get a spiritual impression from
    it, the soul set free.  I tried to ask my guide if Ryoanji was
    still a proper temple with monks or just a tourist attraction,
    never made myself well enough understood.  Nearby was a place
    where they made stone lanterns for temples and other very un-Japanese
    looking statuary.

    I was despondent to learn that Nijo Castle just means 2nd Street
    Castle - how unromantic.  I also learnt that the "mi" component
    of many girl's names is the Chinese "mei" character for beautiful.
    We then went to the [http://www.shokoku-ji.jp/g_about.html Silver Pavilion]
    which has a pavilion like the [https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1152 Golden Pavilion] save it's not covered
    with gold or silver.  The feudal lord's wife put her foot down.  The
    [Silver Pavilion] has a Zen sand garden too, but very different to
    Ryoanji, almost modern artish.  A map of Kyoto has many swastikas on it marking
    the temples.  The swastika has a long history even before it became
    associated with Buddha.  

    We had a slight detour to Mikio's friend cafe.  Now Mikio had asked
    if I would be tired of Japanese food, which I took to mean him asking
    if I minded Japanese food again.  Mikio's actual meaning was that his
    friend served Western style food!  But it was a good visit - his friend
    played a tape of Japanese operatic singing she taught.  She also 
    folded origami, and forced me to take some models she had folded
    after learning my father paper-folded.  I was embarrassed by this, and by
    Mikio's generosity.  I had only brought biscuits from the UK as
    presentos, how cheap.  Mikio had coffee there, and got a tiny thimble
    of milk like Burt did.  Apparently that's the way Japanese take
    coffee!

    We then took the [https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3906.html Philosopher's Walk], which was very beautiful with
    trees in blossom.  At one place people were gaga over a gathering of
    cats, a feline knows how to twist a human around its little claw.
    The Walk wasn't as meditative as when the philosopher walked it,
    houses and shops now intrude, bicyclists hurtle along, tourists 
    snap away as they collect another tourist spot for the record.

    We strolled some way to the Kyoto Handicraft Shop, where I spent
    some money on presents.  Certainly cheaper elsewhere but you might
    spend time finding a bargain.  The shop did take some tax off, and
    I got a pair of chopsticks and postcards as a free bonus.  I had
    asked Mikio to take me to the [http://www.heianjingu.or.jp/ Heian Shrine], but I was
    beginning to be saturated with seeing temples and castles.  So instead
    we headed for the [https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3931.html Nishiki Food Street]!

    This is a long long covered arcade of food stalls.  Not just food.
    An assault of colours and shapes and tastes!  Mikio treated me to
    a sticky syrupy dessert but we had to wait until we reached a department
    store to find a bin to put the messy wrappers in!

    In the evening I walked in the light rain to [http://www.kyoto-gioncorner.com/global/en.html Gion Corner] in the
    the geisha quarter.  Strange mix of the rich Japanese after their
    traditional entertainment, and tourists after the salacious.  The
    show at Gion Corner was aimed at tourists who gawped and snapped
    and laughed at how strange it was.  The actual bunraku and kyogen
    and maiko dancing deserved better, deserved more discerning an
    audience.  The Chinese label the Japanese as "Tang", certainly
    many of these arts and Buddhism in Japan came from the Tang
    dynasty in China.

    A confession.  My supper this evening was a Macdonalds.  I just
    needed the reassurance of my own tongue.  Guilty.
