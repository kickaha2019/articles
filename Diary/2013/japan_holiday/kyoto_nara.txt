    Breakfast at least is cheaper than at the New Takanawa hotel.
    I went for the continental and stoked myself up for the day.
    Couldn't find a fork so resorted to eating the pancakes with
    chopsticks!

    Once again made the mistake of putting thinner socks on for
    a tour including shoes off moments.  This tour gave us assigned
    seat numbers, not sure so necessary.  After a long time of picking
    up others we hit the [https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1165 Nijo Castle] which sounds romantic and
    Oriental but just means 2nd Street Castle.  This is the famous
    castle with the nightingale floor achieved by an iron bracket.
    And was it a cold floor in thin socks.

    Next up was the [https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1152 Golden Pavilion], a very photogenic
    Buddhist site with a golden pavilion in it.  Not quite the
    original pavilion as it has been burnt down many times, lastly
    by a young monk who committed arson in 1950 but
    as photogenic as ever.  It had a 600 year old tree which started out
    as bonsai.  Like every temple complete with gift shop.

    Things got really regimented at the 
    [http://sankan.kunaicho.go.jp/english/index.html Imperial Palace] where we
    had to form four lines to be counted, warned not to touch the
    alarmed walls, warned not to go out of position to take pictures.
    Pretty garden, large site, traditional grand buildings, no heating
    so not used now.

    After a rushed lunch it was off to Nara with new guide Yumi
    to see the deer milling 
    around [Todaiji Temple], which has a very large Buddha indeed in
    the largest wooden building going.
    The deer are rather a pest like pigeons in a park, vendors sell
    deer snacks to be fed to these divine neighbours according to
    Buddhism.  The Japanese capital got moved from Nara to Kyoto
    after political intriguing by the Buddhist monks.

    We also saw the [https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1013 Kasuga Taisha Shrine] associated with the
    Fujiwara family who controlled Japan in the Heian era.
    Many many stone lanterns crowded in on the temple.

    I went to a nearby sushi bar Sushiina, and had a 9-piece
    selection including salmon roe.  A challenge persuading my mouth
    to ahead and bite into it, and my throat to swallow, but worth it.
    I enjoyed my sushi, whilst knowing I am no sushi expert.  I didn't
    eat the first item placed on the green bamboo leaf, not sure if
    it was decoration or a kind of side salad.  The guy serving did
    stop me using soya sauce with one piece - probably real sushi
    eaters don't use soya sauce.

    Rounded off the evening with a green tea flavoured and coloured
    cream puff.
