    Made my way to Osaka on the first funicular railway out of
    Koyasan, and after some fun finding my way to the hotel in
    the labyrinth by JR Osaka station was reunited with my luggage.
    I couldn't check into the disappointing [https://global.hankyu-hotel.com/new-hankyu-osaka/ New Hankyu Hotel] (no
    wifi, very noisy, miles to walk to my room).  So I went off 
    again for an afternoon's tourism on a very bad afternoon for
    tourism, recharging myself on a tempura lunch in one place
    in the Gourmet Museum in the vast underground complex at Osaka
    station.  I dipped the fried prawns into the miso soup instead
    of the tempura sauce which amused the chef!

    [http://www.osakacastle.net/english/ Osaka Castle] was crowded, I wore myself walking up the stairs but
    there was a massive queue for the lifts.  The history about
    Nobunaga and Toyotomi and Ieyasu didn't grab me.  So I tried
    the [https://www.kaiyukan.com/language/eng/index.htm Kaiyukan Aquarium] instead which was even busier.  But somehow
    more enjoyable, a complex change to castles and temples.  So
    fascinating to watch other people, see how they behave.  Not sure of
    the route I took, I realised I could have used the Chuo Metro line
    instead of the Loop Line - hard as an outsider to know what's best.
    On the trains and metro they do have women and children only
    carriages.  The ticket machines didn't respond to my attempts to
    use until I saw people put money in first.  Quite a few ticket
    had buttons to get the menus in English.  At one point a woman
    was trailing a Peanuts themed bag on wheels which was squeaking -
    it proved to be a dog!

    In the evening went back to the Gourmet Museum for another food
    intake.  I had to nerve myself to plunge into a restaurant
    where I could communicate by pointing.  I have no idea of
    what I was eating, what the squishy purple cube was, how I should 
    eaten the different items in their small pots and dishes on my
    plate.  To console myself I decided to have some sake and I went
    wrong here, I should have got the hot cup rather than the cold
    bottle!

    After twice asking directions I went to the [https://www.skybldg.co.jp/ Floating Observatory]
    which is a ring suspended between twin towers.  The lights of
    Osaka are pretty like any big city.  Most mind-numbing was the escalator
    up which is a tube over a very big drop.
