My room knows I'm English.  So the wake up call setting on the
phone talks to me in Anglo-Saxon.  There was a Herald Tribune
in a letter rack outside (close).  I tried breakfast in the
[Marmolada](https://www.princehotels.com:443/newtakanawa/restaurants/slop-side-diner-zakuro-buffet-and-cafe/)
which proved to be a buffet for 2700 Yen
(expensive).  So I aimed to make it an all you can eat buffet
and have breakfast as the most expensive meal of the day.
People were having serials (sic) in glasses, I was bold and
filled up a bowl but then found an absence of spoons!  I only
realised the card I had been handed to start with was meant to
placed in a holder on the table.

Starting hanging around in the hotel lobby for the first tour
to begin.  I met Burt and Priscilla who were from The States but
had also booked with Magical Japan.  It was very pleasant that our
paths coincided a lot over the next few days!  The coach that picked
us up did a tour of hotels then went to a rendezvous where we were
transferred to another coach for the City tour with friendly guide
Yuko.  Yuko first took us to the
[Tokyo Tower](https://www.tokyotower.co.jp/), a red version of the
Eiffel Tower which acted as a TV transmitter for Tokyo until
recently.  (The growth of tall skyscrapers has created reception
shadows so a new Sky Tower of double the height has recently entered
service.). A colleague kindly took me down from the Observation
deck to a floor with windows one could look down through the
ironwork.

We next visited the Meiji shrine in Tokyo where seemingly
Shinto style weddings were being held for the tourists.  Ceremonies
are performances to some extent but it felt an intrusion.  Perhaps
as part of the ceremony an o-daiku (giant drum) was struck very
loudly.  On the way to the shrine passed a vast wall of sake
barrels - sake is one of the five purifyings in Shinto (the others
were water, fire, salt, and passing through a torii gate).  Yuko
demonstrated the water purifying at a water trough with
ladles.  She explained (as did later guides) the mix and match
approach of Japanese to religion.  Buddhism provides funerals as
it also provides reincarnation.  Shinto monopolises a lot of
rituals for the living as you need to get the deities on your
side for exams etc.  Christianity provides Christmas with its
bunting and wrapping paper.

At the Meiji shrine (as at other temples) they sold good luck
charms.  Quaintly these good luck charms wear out after a year
and have to be renewed.  Convenient for the shrine.  These
good luck charms are called "Emma"s.  Yuko showed us one her
daughter had made - not as effective as the real temple
article of course.

The last stop of the morning tour was the Palace gardens.  Very
pretty with the cherry blossom out.  Yuko explained one reason
for the masks was an allergy to cedar pollen.  I was dropped
from the morning tour in Ginza and headed for the basement in
the nearby Mitsukoshi store for food.  I found food - numerous
forms and colours of it in a vast food hall.  Most of it
I had no idea what it was.  But there wasn't any tables to sit at!
I picked a rice thingy, successfully mimed for chopsticks, and
ate on a chair in a waiting area.  Finally time to face the Tokyo
transportation system.

With some trepidation I navigated on the Metro system from
Ginza to Ichigaya.  And totally failed to find the [Nihon Kiin](http://archive.nihonkiin.or.jp/index-e.htm).
My fault.  I needed to do much more research.  One challenge is knowing
exit gate from the station the Nihon Kiin was two minutes from.  That
I didn't know.  But it was an interesting experience.  Helpful
video displays inside the carriages in Japanese and English
say which the doors will open, and othe useful info.  Many stations
had barriers between the platform and line, the trains stop
precisely aligning doors to gates in those barriers.  Cleaners were
at work helping to keep Japan as clean as it is.

I next got myself to Mitaka, this time using the
JR railway as well.  This took a long time and I learnt I didn't
know how to reckon how long getting from A to B takes when A and
B are in Tokyo.  I was feeling worn-out at this point, and almost
gave up on my quest for the
[Ghibli Museum](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/) several times.  I wasn't
sure I was in the right direction as I walked from Mitaka station.
But I persevered and found a wondrous place for children, a treasure
house of animation.  Much of the museum is for children, in scale
if nothing else.  But I did learn there.  About the technology of
art, in the colour swatches and cinema mechanisms and designing.
About how like an engineer an artist needs to be skilled in his
techniques.  About how artists build on other artists, there
were illustrations and sources from pulp comics and Arabic legends
and Victorian romances and Russian fables.

The evening saw an ill-fated act of independence.  I wandered down
to Shinagawa and plumped for a pizza place named "Vento".  The name
should have deterred me!  There was at least a 30 minute wait to eat
inside so I foolishly agreed to eat outside.  And got fumigated
by those smoking outside.  And got toasted by a strange burner
which may have been contributing to global warming, or deterring
tse-tse flies.  For some reason I thought it was clever to order a pizza
made with mustard mayonnaise - yeucch.  And as for the chocolate
orange tea - someone had already had the chocolate orange I think.
It was Saturday night so the world was out and about, it had been
crowded when I returned on the Yamanote loop line to Shinagawa.
