On Thursday (17th) we started our way back down the Rhine,
dropping into Andernach where we had an excursion to the walled
town of Ahrweiler.  Very pretty with a range of olden architectural
styles.  We had a German guide Toni who was very good.
On the way we went through a village with loads of
skulls and crossbones signs - evidently the villagers are
demanding a bypass and capturing coaches in protest.  They were
happily taking a rest that day.

And so we came to Friday (18th) and time sadly to say goodbye
to the people we had met.  Vance our blue coach driver took us
to the naff [Maasmechelen](https://www.maasmechelenvillage.com/nl/home)
shopping village.  Hard to find anywhere to eat, and the kind of stores
which pay the stars who advertise their wares more than the
sweatshops making them.  But it was a mandatory stop
apparently.  We stopped at another Novotel Hotel
[Novotel Valenciennes](https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-0456-novotel-valenciennes/index.shtml), a clone almost of the one at Lille.  This time
the gold coach with the late bookers fared much worse - the manager
walked out apparently of their hotel because of having to deal
with two coaches leaving a poor girl to do everything.

Saturday (19th) we had a relatively short trip to Calais after some
frozen scrambled eggs for breakfast, took
a long time to get through British passport control, then onto a
big car ferry where one queued ages for food and then couldn't find
anywhere good to sit.  Back to the Hythe interchanges and goodbye to
Vance, I should have tipped him more or not at all, never judge these
things well.  Virginia and I found ourselves on a feeder coach with just
six passengers on it!  Absurd.  The Satnav broke down and the driver
had to get it exchanged at Birchanger services.  He kindly dropped
us within walking distance of our front door, meaning we didn't need
to get a taxi home!

Would we do this again?  Not as it stands.  The scenery was
pretty, our fellow passengers agreeable, but I found it very
hard to sleep (easier when the engines were going).  The four days
we spent getting to and fro the cruise itself were tedious and
arduous.
