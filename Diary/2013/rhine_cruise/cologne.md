Most of us had advanced our clocks
so we made breakfast before re-boarding our blue coach.  The plates
for breakfast were rectangular with 3 sections, the scrambled eggs
didn't taste quite right to me.  We crossed
from France into Belgium, an event marked by a sign with 12 stars
and mobile phones receiving welcome texts as they changed to cells
in a new country.  I did manage to doze on the coach making up some
sleep, despite the roads in Belgium being less well maintained.
Stopped at a smelly and child-infested services in Belgium (toilets
free anyway) before resuming our odyssey to Germany.  We stopped
again to allow the gold coach to get to the boat first, and by now
the sun was in evidence!

This second stop near Cologne allowed the Zoll (German road tax
officers) to pounce and check we were legal.  Apparently
an accountant of [National Holidays](https://www.nationalholidays.com)
bungled paying the tax, and the German Zoll impounded a coach
leaving drivers and passengers high and dry!

![Virginia in our cabin](DSCF4653.JPG)
We boarded the [MV Virginia](http://www.transriverline.com/our-ships/mv-virginia/)
safely, not being given the cabin we had booked.  Cabin not very wide,
twin beds.  At lunchtime had to make a big decision - what table should
we sit at?  Where we choose to sit would be where we sat for all the
meals which followed.  A decision I felt reluctant to make!  We sat
with Mary and Raymond and Brenda and Dennis who were nice and friendly
people, in fact everyone on the cruise was pleasant.  Everyone apart from
Virginia and I seemed to be retired.  I knocked over my water that
lunchtime but managed to avoid a repeat performance.  The restaurant was
on the lowest deck and weirdly the bottom of the windows was at the ship's
waterline.  It would have freaked me out to have a cabin on that deck!

After lunch we wandered to see the [Dom](https://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=19167&L=1) (cathedral) in Cologne,
a Catholic church with stylish modern looking stained glass and arrays
of hard to photograph flickering candles.  The outside of the Dom looks
dark and gothic and massive.  We also saw a curious artificial stream
with stepping stones in concrete, and some of old style Cologne where
the outside cafes were putting blankets on chairs so patrons could
wrap up if they felt cold!

Dinner was four courses, the main having chicory smothered in cheese sauce,
I guessed leek and others aubergine.  Again to my surprise at certain times
beer and wine and soft drinks were free on the ship, including dinner
time.  Entertainment in the lounge bar area was a well-built guy playing
an electronic keyboard - a medley of Sinatra and other similar tunes.
He was Eastern European as were a lot of the staff on the boat.
