It was unearthly quiet on the Saturday (12th)
when we had dropped Tabitha and Amelia
off at the Country Cattery in Waterbeach, at the end of a long
one car wide rippling road.  It always feels like
betrayal abandoning them to be in a cage while we're away.
But it did simplify packing the cases and getting
ready for an earlier start on the Sunday than I usually
have.

Sunday was pouring it down everywhere we went, the [Panther](https://www.panthertaxis.co.uk/) taxi
came promptly at 9am which I was disappointed at.  Even with what
seemed to me like a scenic tour through Cambridge we arrived at
the coach stop opposite the [Arundel House Hotel](https://www.arundelhousehotels.co.uk/) with nearly an hour to
stand in the downpour until the coach was due to come!  Virginia found
a bus shelter not too far away, but happily the
[Shearings](https://www.shearings.com/) feeder coach was running well ahead of time and arrived about
9.30am.  She had booked a 'Rhine Inclusive Cruise' on the
**MV Virginia** so we could sample a river cruise as opposed to the ocean
cruises we've done.

We drove down the M11 to 60s 70s hits like "Space Oddity" and
"Pinball Wizard" and "Sunny Afternoon" and "I'll Never Fall
In Love Again".  There was plenty of leg-room in the gold coloured
Setra coach - sadly we got blue-coloured Setra coaches after that
which have more seats squeezed into them, and so not enough leg-room.
There's a lot of organisation behind what Shearings do, and a lot of
people backing it all up.  Sometimes the best-laid plans don't work out,
we stopped at Thurrock for six more passengers but the taxi
bringing four of them had broken down.  So we set off to Shearings
[Hythe Interchange](https://www.stop24.co.uk/) base and had
a burger before changing to a different Shearings coach, our tour
bus for the 'Rhine Inclusive Cruise' driven by a guy called Vance.
I wondered about how Vance and the tour guide June and the
staff on the MV Virginia handle their (to me) strange lifestyle,
the strange pattern of days.

A short run to [Dover port](http://www.doverport.co.uk) where
a French customs officer came onto the coach to make sure we
hadn't forgotten our passports.  The port staff directed us and
other vehicles onto the P&O ferry while trying to stop a trio of
French students who were trying to sneak on the ferry by
hitch-hiking.  We found a good place to sit at on the ferry and
I started my intense session of reading Edgar Wallace novels on
the iPad.  I got through nearly twenty in all by the end of the
holiday.

Vance drove us through a sodden and depressing looking France
to the [Novotel Lille hotel](https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-0427-novotel-lille-airport/index.shtml) at Lille Aeroport.  Room not bad though it felt odd to
me having a separate toilet and bathroom.  They gave us a decent
3 course meal with cloying chocolate pudding as the coup de grace.
The other (gold) coach of the two for the 'Rhine Inclusive Cruise' stopped
at a better hotel - at that stage the people on board seemed to
have benefitted from booking later.
