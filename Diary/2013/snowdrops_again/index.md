Our annual pilgrimage to see the snowdrops at
[Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill).  How much is the National Trust running
[Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill) for us to see our heritage, how much is it
running it as a business?  I was struck as we sat in the posh
cafeteria by the adverts for people to hire [Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill) for
weddings and corporate events.
