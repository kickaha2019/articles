	Our annual pilgrimage to see the snowdrops at 
	[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill Anglesey Abbey].  How much is the National Trust running 
	Anglesey Abbey for us to see our heritage, how much is it
	running it as a business?  I was struck as we sat in the posh
	cafeteria by the adverts for people to hire Anglesey Abbey for
	weddings and corporate events.
