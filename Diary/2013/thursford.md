Happily no water-splashes this year to drive through on our way
to [Thursford](https://www.thursford.com) for this year's Christmas show there.
This year we also disobeyed the Satnav and didn't go through farmyards
or down one car wide tracks in the back of beyond.

The show itself was as good as last year, apart from the comedian
being a little too blue for our liking, not as crude as some true.

The shops get very crowded, too crowded when all the coaches have
disgorged their passengers.  We ate in the marquee which had a
strange inflated tube in the ceiling apparently for heating.  Every
so often a pulse of hot air? would shoot down the roof.  We had
a bite to eat after the show to let the stampede finish, but also
to speak a bit more with my cousin Pat and husband who we met
up with there.

Heard how the show has evolved from its early days, when it
was local choirs and performers in a barn, to its modern incarnation
of professionalism and big stage.  The show itself is what
keeps Thursford running.  It's unique.

I do like that the show doesn't shy away from talking about
Jesus Christ as the Christ in Christmas.  It's not evangelical
in tone, but it has religious roots.
