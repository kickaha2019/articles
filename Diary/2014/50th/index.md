The weekend saw a major milestone - Virginia turned 50!  She had chosen
to have a barn dance to celebrate (or Ceilidh sounds more classy doesn't it!)
So we turned up at the [Baptist Church](https://www.histonbaptist.org.uk/)
in Histon at 5pm (this being a convenient
good sized venue which we knew well.)  And discovered we had left the Church key
at home.  Minor panic dealt with.  So back again to start setting up for the
kick-off time of 7pm.

I had been worrying about all the chair moving around that was going to be
required beforehand, and while it was just Virginia and I trying to get the
main hall clear I was panicking, convincing myself I was wearing myself out.
It really lifted my spirits when friends arrived early and gave a hand to
creating a dancing space.  Not just that the job got done quicker, them just
being there was vital moral support.  To have the feeling there's other people
there to share the load is so precious.

We had fun too trying to work out how to get the lights on properly - happily
among those coming to the Ceilidh were people who attended the Baptist Church
so knew more about the illumination system than we did!  At least the daylight
sufficed while the band playing for the Ceilidh were setting.  Virginia hired
a group called [Fendragon](https://www.fendragon.co.uk)
and they were very good.  I was embarrassed by the
challenges we presented the caller of getting people to come up and dance, but
there were enough.  Virginia and I danced all but one of the dances, including
one called "Threading the needle" which went amusingly wrong for our group of eight.
We had someone with Parkinsons, and someone else who's a little slow, who
simply couldn't follow what they were meant to be doing.  At least the caller
was entertained!

I had done four boards with pictures of Virginia through the ages - there were
differing opinions on where to put them around the hall, in the end they
ended up near the tables with puddings and drinks on them which worked OK.
I'm slowly learning not to worry so much if I don't get my own way, and my
initial layout of the picture boards got overruled quite quickly.  Ah yes the
puddings.  Virginia had opted for a puddings and Barn Dance party - and we
had plenty of puddings, too many in fact.  Sadly some just got binned at
the end, there was no alternative.  My sister did two cakes (one sponge one
fruit I don't like fruit cakes) with books and cats on them, very nice.
My niece Beth put blue cats on the icing cats which was spot on!

Virginia had invited a good range of people including our neighbours - they
turned up early and sat right at the back, not mixing that much.  I hope
they enjoyed themselves, they probably weren't up for too energetic
activities.  It was very pleasant to see some old faces, people we
hadn't seen for a long time.  To my surprise my hirsute nephew Andrew also
turned up, it had been his birthday this last week and I still need to get
his present to him.

The party finished about ten and we were very grateful to all those who
got stuck in to clearing up.  That made a mega difference.  I hope we
got the main hall back towards the way it had been laid out!  It was
raining when we carried out the debris to the car, and there was quite
a bit of it.  Later on I worried if we had removed the 50th birthday banner
I sellotaped up in the entrance foyer!  My nephew was puzzlingly sitting
in his car in the carpark for a while - I was told he's into tweeting and
has hundreds of followers!

Sunday was Virginia's real birthday.  To try and do something special I
folded paper boats out of wrapping paper and set them on the lounge floor
on a long reach of kitchen foil, then placed our soft toys with the cards
and presents on them.  Like many of my ideas I don't know how well it
really worked.  I got Virginia a book "Entry Island" she wanted plus a
necklace with a topaz - the necklace chain was too small so more like a
choker!

Virginia booked a Chinese restaurant Tai Yuen in Toft (our favourite Chinese the Phoenix
in Histon doesn't open on Sundays).  We were the only ones in there for
Sunday lunch, it was nice enough.  Another converted pub like the Phoenix.
The Toft place offers an all you can eat which we went for but
disappointed the English waitress by not gorging ourselves - we felt
we had plenty even without seconds!
