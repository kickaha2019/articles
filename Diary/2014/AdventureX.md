I went up to London for the day to see some of the fourth
[AdventureX](http://adventurexpo.org/welcome-to-adventurex/) computer games convention.
There's a writeup on [GameBoomers](http://www.gameboomers.com/Editorial/2014AdventureX/2014AdventureX.htm).

I had the luck to interview [Theodor Waern](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/TheodorWaern/TalkwithTheodorWaern.htm),
and [Dave Gilbert](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/DaveGilbert/DaveGilbert.htm).
