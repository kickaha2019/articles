![A handy municipal fountain in Cadiz](fountain.JPG)
We used footpower to see Cadiz rather than go on an excursion.  To my
surprise Cadiz was pretty and mostly clean - though I involuntarily side-stepped into
something undesirable and had to use a municipal fountain to clean a sandal.

My meagre knowledge of the romance languages was enough to guess when
we bought some biscuits to take back that the shop assistant wanted forty odd
euros. It's a work tradition to return from a break with something edible
and ethnic.

Reportedly some of our ship got pickpocketed in Cadiz - I have no reason to
think Cadiz any worse than London or even Cambridge (tourists are regarded as
legitimate prey by some locals there).
