We wandered somewhat aimlessly into Corfu and didn't see anything touristy.  Will
have to be braver and hazard the shuttle bus next time.  There was fun in the
port with a ferry bearing lorries and cars.  It had apparently managed to get
holed on some rocks, and its passengers were scattered around on what grass and
benches were available.
