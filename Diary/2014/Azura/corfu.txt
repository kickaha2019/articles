	We wandered somewhat aimlessly into Corfu and didn't see anything touristy.  Will
	have to be braver and hazard the shuttle bus next time.  There was fun in the 
	port with a ferry bearing lorries and cars.  It had apparently managed to get
	holed on some rocks, and its passengers were scattered around on what grass and
	benches were available.

	Corfu: metal sculpture or derelict sign? Perhaps both!
