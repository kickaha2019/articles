![Dubrovnik's walls facing the sea](seawalls.JPG)
We did a sea and land excursion to a crowded Dubrovnik, which proved to be
a very pretty old walled city. Narrow passageways, old fountains, city walls one could walk on.
Apparently in winter the old walled city is nearly empty the guide said. Didn't really
use the hour plus we had as free time, just sat on a shaded bench. Learnt quarantine derived from Italian for forty days!

The Azura was moored next to its sister ship Ventura, apparently only half full.  Lots of
passengers were doubting P&amp;O's wisdom in going for bigger ships.
