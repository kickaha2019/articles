Rather like our house has a washing machine and TV the *Azura* has
facilities for day to day necessities and amusement.  There are several
laundrettes which always seemed busy.  There's a variety of places to
eat, perhaps because of the number of passengers (3000+) at times
like scrums.  There are talks and and dance lessons and performances to divert
one from looking at the sea.

(Watching the line dancing was mesmerising in its way - it made me think of
Aboriginal dancing where the tribe dances as a single individual. We're
not that far from when we used to ritual dance before flame lit images
on the cave walls.)

I went to a series of introductory talks on the iPad and other tablets, and
learnt some facts I didn't know from them!  Obvious stuff like the control bar you
get from swiping up from the bottom, the magnifying glass which appears if you hover with pen down,
thoughts on charging, Safari and reading lists. So many things are obvious once
you know, but not before.

We went to some of the shows in the evening.  The best shows were those done by
the P&amp;O theatre company Headliners, energetic and committed.  I was most thrilled by
excerpts from shows I knew well, perhaps you need to have the buzz from seeing the whole show
before you can be trilled by a single song?  There were a number of singers which didn't do
so much for me, some of whom were beyond their sell by date.  I got dragged along to
the crew talent show - the best being the second singer who with integrity avoided
singing any correct notes.

There wasn't a proper cinema on board which was surprising. We watched the colourful
[Lego Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/) (the only two people to do so at the time!) Next time I may bring some
films on the iPad and watch those!
