I did see some dolphins this day to make up for missing them and the
waterspout the day before.  Beautiful as they moved. Hardened sea colour shapes
which leapt out of the water into existence then melted back into the waves.

We walked into Gibraltar as did 1000s of others - very crowded and warm.
