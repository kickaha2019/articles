Many days of the cruise I had a stroll on deck, both as exercise and as a quiet time.
Virginia each time warned me not to fall overboard.  One of the shames of the Azura is that
you can't walk all round the ship properly so I only walked up and down the port side (the
starboard side people smoked on).
