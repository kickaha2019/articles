	Many days of the cruise I had a stroll on deck, both as exercise and as a quiet time.
	Virginia each time warned me not to fall overboard.  One of the shames of the Azura is that 
	you can't walk all round the ship properly so I only walked up and down the port side (the
	starboard side people smoked on).
