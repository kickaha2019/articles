	We've started going to some of the quizzes that are run by the
	Entertainment Team on board the ships we cruise on.  Most days we
	made to the Individual Quiz held late afternoon in either Brodie's
	or the Blue Bar.
	
	Attendance at these quizzes varies from a handful to getting on
	for thirty to forty. The questions range from how many feet in
	nine yards to arcane topics like when was decimalisation brought in
	(1971 was the official answer). At one quiz there was barely anyone
	else there, I could answer most of the questions, and for once in my
	life I found myself a winner!  
	
	So I found myself with a gold sticker on a special card for collecting
	gold stickers.  (I only got one gold sticker, lightning only strikes once
	and all that.)  With considerable curiosity we went along to the
	Karmala Room at 6pm to find out what one gold sticker would mean in the
	way of a prize. I was expecting perhaps a sock, or even a pair of socks.
	To my joy it was actually something useful that I really wanted! A P&amp;O memory
	stick! Really good!
	
	Not everyone honoured the individual part of the Individual Quiz. A gang of
	four sat near us on the last quiz comparing answers even with the 
	quiz master making repeated requests that everyone do the by themselves.
	This lot were more than miffed that even with their cheating they
	didn't win, and had to console themselves by loudly accusing everyone else
	of cheating. Nothing like a good loser is there?
	
	Perhaps I should give a small quiz of my own.
	
	''Question 1'': how can the photographer business on board Azura make a profit?
	
	''Question 2'': how are the kitchens able to offer such a wide of
	dishes?
	
	''Question 3'': how are P&amp;O going to regularly fill their new ship Britannia?
