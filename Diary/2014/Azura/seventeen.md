![Seventeen entrance on Azura](entrance.JPG)
Each cruise we have had a special meal by ourselves instead of eating in the
usual place. Despite the cover charge (&pound;28 each) we went to the
Jamie Oliver *Seventeen* restaurant on board.  And had a great meal.
The food was artistically presented, and there were unsolicited courses
(a teacup of green soup and a dessert).  Less of a conveyor belt than
the Oriental Restaurant (on these cruises I am impressed by how much work
the poor staff do).  Eating as it should be (except for the prowling
photographers who seem to think we go on cruises to be snapped and pay
exorbitant amounts for the privilege).

The only downside was that I was thinking as we went that at least here
we don't have to worry about sharing the restaurant with the screaming
kiddie who 'enlivened' our Oriental Restaurant experience. The adults with him
didn't seem to mind as he tried his best to smash through a window with
whatever came to hand. I did wish him good luck. Scarcely had we sat down
in *Seventeen* but they turned up! An appointment in Samarra!
