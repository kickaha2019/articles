I will remember Venice as the highlight of this cruise, and especially the
enchanting ride on a gondola.  This really gave me an impression of Venice as an ancient city
with rills for roads. A city where you get around in a boat, where you might take a
vaporetto rather than a taxi.  A city defined by water not by land.

On our tour we saw the famous Bridge of Sighs which led to the prison, the
[Doge's Palace](https://palazzoducale.visitmuve.it/en/home/)
from which not only Venice was ruled but also the vast area Venice had dominion over
when it was a city state.  We also trooped around [St Marks Basilica](http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/), from which the water
had just receded.  As an organised tour we beat the massive queues in St Marks Square.
There were seven cruise ships in and Venice was packed. People said this was the last
time cruise ships could sail up the Grand Canal.

We didn't however beat the dire massive queue to get back on board though, or the massive
walk from where the shuttle boat dropped us off to the cruise terminal. The system just
couldn't cope with the sheer numbers even without the Italians doing everything in their
own time.

Even back on board our problems weren't over - we were too late for proper food, the
buffet was crowded and slow.  So we had a good lamb burger in the Glass House albeit
it took ages to come.
