	I will remember Venice as the highlight of this cruise, and especially the
	enchanting ride on a gondola.  This really gave me an impression of Venice as an ancient city 
	with rills for roads. A city where you get around in a boat, where you might take a
	vaporetto rather than a taxi.  A city defined by water not by land.
	
	On our tour we saw the famous Bridge of Sighs which led to the prison, the
	[https://palazzoducale.visitmuve.it/en/home/ Doge's Palace]
	from which not only Venice was ruled but also the vast area Venice had dominion over
	when it was a city state.  We also trooped around [http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/ St Marks Basilica], from which the water
	had just receded.  As an organised tour we beat the massive queues in St Marks Square.
	There were seven cruise ships in and Venice was packed. People said this was the last
	time cruise ships could sail up the Grand Canal.

	We didn't however beat the dire massive queue to get back on board though, or the massive
	walk from where the shuttle boat dropped us off to the cruise terminal. The system just
	couldn't cope with the sheer numbers even without the Italians doing everything in their
	own time.
	
	Even back on board our problems weren't over - we were too late for proper food, the
	buffet was crowded and slow.  So we had a good lamb burger in the Glass House albeit
	it took ages to come.
