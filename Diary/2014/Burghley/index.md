After going to see my mother's gravestone in Histon Virginia and I
then drove up to Stamford to see
[Burghley House](https://www.burghley.co.uk/), only slightly held up by a A14 stop start standstill.
It was a dull day with dollops of dampness, not good for the camera and
I hadn't got the batteries charged properly either.

The size of the place intimidated us, we had to drive round it before
we could drive into the estate, and then walk a fair distance between
the different attractions.  The food perhaps wasn't as good as a National
Trust place, but the *Gardens of Surprise* was splendid, a set of
artistic water fountain themed displays.  There were devices you could
actuate, trapped doorways which you risked a soaking going through,
and eerie Roman busts which moved when you weren't looking.

The modern sculptures we mostly passed on.  The house was
over opulent - so many rooms had a surfeit of paintings or
painted walls and ceilings.  The kitchen impressed with the array
of copper pans and dishes, and also a collection of turtle skulls
marking the times costly turtle soup had been served.  The ranks of
bells marking which room a servant should be dispatched were there
to see.  The chapel in the house was a bit unusual, more like
a meeting room than an old chapel as I was expecting.

Not so many people there, the school party were on a different
route through to us.
