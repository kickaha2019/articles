	After going to see my mother's gravestone in Histon Virginia and I
	then drove up to Stamford to see 
	[https://www.burghley.co.uk/ Burghley House], only slightly held up by a A14 stop start standstill.
	It was a dull day with dollops of dampness, not good for the camera and
	I hadn't got the batteries charged properly either.

	The size of the place intimidated us, we had to drive round it before 
	we could drive into the estate, and then walk a fair distance between
	the different attractions.  The food perhaps wasn't as good as a National
	Trust place, but the ''Gardens of Surprise'' was splendid, a set of
	artistic water fountain themed displays.  There were devices you could
	actuate, trapped doorways which you risked a soaking going through,
	and eerie Roman busts which moved when you weren't looking.

	The modern sculptures we mostly passed on.  The house was 
	over opulent - so many rooms had a surfeit of paintings or
	painted walls and ceilings.  The kitchen impressed with the array
	of copper pans and dishes, and also a collection of turtle skulls
	marking the times costly turtle soup had been served.  The ranks of
	bells marking which room a servant should be dispatched were there
	to see.  The chapel in the house was a bit unusual, more like
	a meeting room than an old chapel as I was expecting.

	Not so many people there, the school party were on a different
	route through to us.
