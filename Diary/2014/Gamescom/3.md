Had my one and only breakfast at the hotel then sent off the
postcards from Cologne main station (after a hunt for the post office
there). There is a trend to stick "Mc" on the front of shops and
goods here - so there was "McPaper" and "McClean".

Walked across the Hohenzollern Bridge which is adorned with padlocks
from romantically minded couples to the Kolnmesse site. To my surprise
they accepted my press pass - after I had to queue as my print out wasn't
good enough! In the queue it seemed like people were blathering their way
to press passes despite what the website claimed about eligibility. Could
have turned up earlier to avoid rush.

Started tracking down people I hoped to see in the business halls
4.1 and 4.2.  I asked after Agust&iacute;n Cordes at the Argentinian area
and I said his name so wrong
they didn't realise who I was after! Agust&iacute;n is more Agoustine or so
it sounded.  I saw Agust&iacute;n later and he recognised who I had to be!
I felt a momentary glow of fame!

Interviewed [Kre&#353;imir &#352;pes](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/KSpesInterview/KSpesInterview.htm) of
*Cateia Games* at the Croatian booth - Kaptain Brawe should be said
Captain Brave (I'm a little confused as Serbo-Croat doesn't have a w). But the spelling stuck.

At the Swiss Games booth I met
[Mike Huber](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/PerilsofMan/PerilsofMan.htm) of
*IF Studios*. Confused things a little by mistakenly thinking I
was meeting Kimara Rouwit - I tend to speed-read books and emails and
that's not always a good idea!  IF Studios are developing
[Perils of Man](https://www.perilsofman.com) -
a promising multi platform Adventure game.

Talked to [Agust&iacute;n Cordes](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/AgustinCordes/AgustinCordes.htm) of [Senscape](https://talk.senscape.io) who showed me
the Unity improvements to "Asylum", as well as what a new Kickstarter
in October will be for.

Had demo of [The Vanishing of Ethan Carter](http://www.theastronauts.com/)
(not for me I think) and
[Book of Unwritten Tales 2](http://de.unwritten-tales.com/) which
I've already signed up to play!

A damp return walk. I dined at nearby Tang Wei Chinese restaurant as it
was so wet, reassured by the Chinese people eating there.
Hard to choose from the menu as the dishes were meant for two people!
Quaint that I was able to understand what the Chinese were saying better than
I can the German natives. Wo keyi yong Putonghua tanhua yidiar. Something
like that.
