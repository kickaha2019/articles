Started the day with sausage and egg muffin and OJ from the station
Macdonalds - I preferred it to the hotel breakfast.

On the off chance approached Charles Cecil of
[Revolution Games](https://revolution.co.uk) in the UK area
and he gave a great impromptu interview! Great guy, very friendly and
approachable, full of interesting words. The
[interview](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/CharlesCecil/CharlesCecil.htm) was so good
it gave me a big problem - it needs to be published by itself not
as as part of a composite interview. So my plan of a composite
interview really didn't work, I would have been wiser to ask questions
tailored to each interviewee not go for a set list of questions.

I really stuffed up meeting with Jan Kavan, he kindly texted me to
suggest a sensible location to meet and I tried to text back - three times
only managing to send empty messages! I shall have to find a four-year old
child to show me how to use my phone. And then I managed to find
something which wasn't the fruit bar to wait at . . . drat drat drat.
Jan and Lukas Medek of [CBESoftware](http://cbe-software.com)
gave me a demo of J.U.L.I.A. - this game deserves to do very well.

(Agust&iacute;n's help was significant - he told me Jonas Kyratzes was here,
as well as relaying messages to Jan and encouraging me to try Charles Cecil.)

I interviewed [Jan Theysen](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/JanTheysen/JanTheysen.htm) of [King Art Games](https://kingart-games.com/) after short demo of BOUT 2.

I met [Laney Berry](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/LaneyBerry/LaneyBerry.htm)
of [Classroom Graffiti](https://www.classroom-graffiti.com) in a dampened beer garden,
wasn't sure it was her but few there with red hair! Didn't recognise her
from her Facebook picture, but I don't think I'll be any good given an
identity parade. I did take to Gamescom pictures of people to help find
them.

Florian Emmerich and Ragnar Tornquist demoed "Dreamfall Chapters"
from [Red Thread Games](https://www.redthreadgames.com). A living game world.

In the business halls there was quite a number of Chinese and Korean
booths, I'm quite into Korean culture at the moment and tried to discuss
Hallyu with with someone at a Korean booth, but she lived in Germany and
knew less about new Korean films like [The Pirates](https://movie.naver.com/movie/bi/mi/basic.nhn?code=102817) than I did!
But I'm not interested in football or cricket so this was a little myopic
to think every Korean is interested in everything Korean.

I descended twice into the hell of Hall 10.1 in search of Jonas Kyratzes.
Crowded dark formless young roaming swirling around platforms with
loud voices blaring out. Chaos clash of images lights videos. If I had been Orpheus then
there were plenty of cosplay Eurydices to choose from. But no trace of
Jonas Kyratzes. He I found out later was in the more civilised business
area.

I ate out this evening at a historic 12th century Gasthaus,
great olde-world style inside. Very nicely cooked calf's liver,
followed by vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. The mixing of the hot
chocolate and ice cream reminded me of the treat for school dinners so long
ago - the way the white and dark blended into so many strands of colour. It
also reminded me of Tabitha's fur (she's a chocolate colour point). Walked
back past the Dom, the church bells ringing into one another, sounding like
an alien machine.
