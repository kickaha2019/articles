Four helpful German m&auml;dchen tried to assist me buying a tourist U bahn ticket
but the machine didn't like my credit card. I didn't have enough coinage to
try bribing the machine either. A stressful journey from Breslauer to
Kolnmesse, almost went badly wrong at Neumarkt, then followed the crowd to
the North entrance. My press pass got me in quickly, I walked swiftly through
the temporary temples for games waiting for worshippers to arrive.

(For some reason I found the underground easier to navigate in Japan
than in Germany!)

A shared appointment to see the latest [Frogwares](http://frogwares.com) Sherlock Holmes, they
let me demonstrate my uselessness at controlling the game using a
game pad! I found the interface too disorientating.

I frequented the sushi bar again to keep me going through lunchtime,
this time having more pieces, and a cereal bar for dessert.

The lunchtime belonged to
[Daedalic Entertainment](https://www.daedalic.com/?lang_new=en). A presentation of
the Whispered World sequel *Silence*,
then *Fire* starring a caveman with
very limited vocabulary, then *Blackguards 2* (a sequel to
the RPG *Blackguards* which
revises the ruleset and other features, then Kevin Mentz's
*The Devil's Men*
which like *Dreamfall Chapters* offers the player choices to be made.
Daedalic were generous with PR material but it added to my rucksack's
weight and bulkiness!  I was very lucky to be able to interview
[Kevin Mentz](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/KevinMentz/KevinMentz.htm)
as he designed *Memoria*
which I found a deliciously bitter-sweet game.

Andreas Heldt and Michelle Waschk of [Z-Software](https://z-software.net/site/about/)
told me about their upcoming game
[History in Letters - The Eternal Alchemist](https://z-software.net/site/history-in-letters-the-eternal-alchemist/)
which is what I would call an Adventure lite game.

The last interview of Gamescom was with
[Jonas Kyratzes](http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/JonasKyratzes/JonasKyratzes.htm), who's
working with [Croteam](http://www.croteam.com) on
[The Talos Principle](http://www.croteam.com/talosprinciple/).
The website says "Game is dealing with philosophical issues of transhumanity".
Jonas is a very thoughful guy, a creator of idea rich indie games.

Got soaked walking back from Gamescom as the journey ended in a
thunderstorm, and to my deep regret chickened out of the Adventure Treff
party and instead found a nearby Trattorio - here the table had a bottle of
balsamic vinegar and olive oil on it for the bread.
