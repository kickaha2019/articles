	Four helpful German m&auml;dchen tried to assist me buying a tourist U bahn ticket
	but the machine didn't like my credit card. I didn't have enough coinage to
	try bribing the machine either. A stressful journey from Breslauer to
	Kolnmesse, almost went badly wrong at Neumarkt, then followed the crowd to
	the North entrance. My press pass got me in quickly, I walked swiftly through
	the temporary temples for games waiting for worshippers to arrive.
	
	(For some reason I found the underground easier to navigate in Japan
	than in Germany!)

	A shared appointment to see the latest [http://frogwares.com Frogwares] Sherlock Holmes, they
	let me demonstrate my uselessness at controlling the game using a
	game pad! I found the interface too disorientating.

	I frequented the sushi bar again to keep me going through lunchtime, 
	this time having more pieces, and a cereal bar for dessert.

	The lunchtime belonged to 
	[Daedalic Entertainment]. A presentation of
	the Whispered World sequel ''Silence'',
	then ''Fire'' starring a caveman with
	very limited vocabulary, then ''Blackguards 2'' (a sequel to
	the RPG ''Blackguards'' which
	revises the ruleset and other features, then Kevin Mentz's
	''The Devil's Men''
	which like ''Dreamfall Chapters'' offers the player choices to be made.
	Daedalic were generous with PR material but it added to my rucksack's
	weight and bulkiness!  I was very lucky to be able to interview
	[http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/KevinMentz/KevinMentz.htm Kevin Mentz]
	as he designed ''Memoria''
	which I found a deliciously bitter-sweet game.

	Andreas Heldt and Michelle Waschk of [https://z-software.net/site/about/ Z-Software]
	told me about their upcoming game 
	[https://z-software.net/site/history-in-letters-the-eternal-alchemist/ History in Letters - The Eternal Alchemist]
	which is what I would call an Adventure lite game.

	The last interview of Gamescom was with
	[http://www.gameboomers.com/interviews/JonasKyratzes/JonasKyratzes.htm Jonas Kyratzes], who's
	working with [http://www.croteam.com Croteam] on 
	[http://www.croteam.com/talosprinciple/ The Talos Principle]. 
	The website says "Game is dealing with philosophical issues of transhumanity".
	Jonas is a very thoughful guy, a creator of idea rich indie games.

	Got soaked walking back from Gamescom as the journey ended in a 
	thunderstorm, and to my deep regret chickened out of the Adventure Treff
	party and instead found a nearby Trattorio - here the table had a bottle of
	balsamic vinegar and olive oil on it for the bread.
