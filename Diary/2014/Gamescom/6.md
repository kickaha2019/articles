My grateful thanks go to Agustin Cordes who inspired this,
Laura Macdonald who helped and advised and connected,
Marita and Ana of [GameBoomers](http://www.gameboomers.com) who made it possible,
and Michael Stein of [Adventure Treff](http://www.adventure-treff.de)
who I bothered with many inane questions.

The iPad worked incredibly well as a multi-purpose device. I could have
taken pictures with it as well but didn't. Transcribing the
interviews did take an incredible amount of time though.

Attending Gamescom in a press capacity is a great way of meeting
those behind the Adventure games I play. It's not the same as
actually being a game developer, but personally I wouldn't recommend
that as a career only as a hobby.

[Unity](https://unity3d.com) is winning out as the game engine to
implement Adventures in at the moment. Did speak to people
at the *Unity* stand, they said do the tutorials which is
a fair comment.  I might play with *Unity* myself.

There's a possible trend with games offering choices which
just don't affect which ending you get, but affect lines of play
and game interactions. This is significant as a lot of game
innovation has been areas like graphics and then graphics and
again graphics. Introducing meaningful choices is evolving
how stories are told, and
for me story is what drives an Adventure game.

I need better wet weather protection - and I live in England
so no excuses.
