	My grateful thanks go to Agustin Cordes who inspired this, 
	Laura Macdonald who helped and advised and connected, 
	Marita and Ana of [http://www.gameboomers.com GameBoomers] who made it possible,
	and Michael Stein of [http://www.adventure-treff.de Adventure Treff] 
	who I bothered with many inane questions.

	The iPad worked incredibly well as a multi-purpose device. I could have 
	taken pictures with it as well but didn't. Transcribing the
	interviews did take an incredible amount of time though.
	
	Attending Gamescom in a press capacity is a great way of meeting
	those behind the Adventure games I play. It's not the same as
	actually being a game developer, but personally I wouldn't recommend
	that as a career only as a hobby.
	
	[https://unity3d.com Unity] is winning out as the game engine to
	implement Adventures in at the moment. Did speak to people
	at the ''Unity'' stand, they said do the tutorials which is
	a fair comment.  I might play with ''Unity'' myself.
	
	There's a possible trend with games offering choices which
	just don't affect which ending you get, but affect lines of play
	and game interactions. This is significant as a lot of game
	innovation has been areas like graphics and then graphics and
	again graphics. Introducing meaningful choices is evolving 
	how stories are told, and
	for me story is what drives an Adventure game.
	
	I need better wet weather protection - and I live in England
	so no excuses.
