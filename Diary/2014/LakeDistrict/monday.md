On the Monday we went to see [Holker Hall](https://www.holker.co.uk), owned by the Cavendish
family who are connected to the famous scientist of that ilk.  Homely formal gardens, stately home
crammed with antique stuff including a lignum vitae chest which the guide said some visitors
couldn't resist opening after being told such chests were used to carry treasure because they
don't float.
