The cats got delivered on the Saturday to Grange Cattery in Waterbeach, to be looked
after by the reliable Phyllis.  There's at least a pond with fish in it for them to look at.  The road
there is so uneven it's like driving over the sea if the sea were frozen in a split-second
of time!  Saturday evening saw packing, I only took the iPad for reading currently I'm reading
my way through the works of [Edgar Wallace](http://www.edgarwallace.org), a prolific writer
of thrillers.  He also did the screenplay for "King Kong".  This time among other books I read his minor
novelette "Planetoid 127", a rare excursion into Science Fiction for him.  This had in it
the idea there's a second Earth on the opposite side of the sun to us so we can't see it -
an idea used later on.

A long drive on the Sunday up to the Lake District, made more miserable by the cloudbursts, seeing dead
foxes along the road, seeing sheep crammed like sardines into a lorry, by miles and miles of
roadworks, by being ripped off for diesel at a service station.  The markup is extortionate.
We reached [Abbot Hall Hotel](https://www.christianguild.co.uk/abbothall/index.php)
safely, after some confusion thanks to the Satnav.  I would have to describe the hotel as
pleasantly run-down, it has character due to its haphazard history, the staff were friendly,
we shared meals with the other residents (though we did lower the average age somewhat!)
It made a good base.  Rooms have been recently renovated there so run-down is a little
unfair.  The food was pretty good though Virginia is on a dairy-free diet and felt the choice
was limited to non-existent at times.
