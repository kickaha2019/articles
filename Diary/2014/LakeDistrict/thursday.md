Our last full day was the Thursday, we visited the
[South Lakes Safari Zoo](https://www.southlakessafarizoo.com/) and saw the backside of a tiger sheltering
from the English weather, mangy deer, lions at least braving the day, rhinos.  I found the
place rather depressing as a reminder of how Man has trashed the planet.  On the plus side
homo sapiens is well on the way to making itself extinct.

More rewarding was going to [Swarthmoor Hall](https://www.swarthmoorhall.co.uk/), a key place
in Quaker history.  The hospitable staff looked after us well.  The hall was interesting, an
ornate newel post now 4 foot short as the roof had been raised.  George Fox's travelling
bed out of lignum vitae strung with ropes (the saying about sleep tight supposedly refers to
tightening the ropes beds had once for supporting the bolsters people slept on.  There was
a table with a reversible top, one side rough one side smooth (hence take the rough with the
smooth supposedly).  George Fox preached about the importance of personal faith as opposed to
Church establishment, and was very unpopular with the Church of his day.

Friday and we wended our weary way home.  Crawling along at times.  We had an early lunch,
getting something in a brown bag from a Burger King.  To my concern a member of staff came up
afterwards and asked if we were OK - I don't really want to know why!  I've survived long
enough to write about it anyway.
