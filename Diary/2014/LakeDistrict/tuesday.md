Tuesday and we ventured to see [Hill Top](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hill-top), a house
belonging to Beatrix Potter.  A place of pilgrimage for Japanese as much as for English, I
don't know why.  The Satnav wasn't entirely to blame when it led us on a route which culminated
in it telling us to take the ferry across Lake Windermere - sadly the ferry wasn't running!
Beatrix Potter brings to mind children's stories like Peter Rabbit but she was an
important figure in preserving the Lake District as it is for us to see now.  She also
went round sales buying old samplers and the like.  Car parking is very restricted at Hill Top,
I was glad we were there out of high season!
