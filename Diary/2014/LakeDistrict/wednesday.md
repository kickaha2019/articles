Wednesday was the best day.  We took in the [Lakeside Aquarium](https://lakesaquarium.co.uk/),
not the size of other aquariums I've been to true but there were things to see and learn there.
Such as ants crawling along a rope to transport food, or the mention of sex changing fish (examples
of both ways).  Virginia and I then took the [Windermere Cruiser](https://www.windermere-lakecruises.co.uk)
from Lakeside to Bowness and back, with enough time for a toasted cheese sandwich at Bowness for
me.  Very pleasant very tranquil cruising on the water on a lightly loaded ship, seeing scenery
out of "Swallows and Amazons".  Something archetypal in the landscape that matched complemented
the unconscious.

On the way back we patronised the [Lakeland Motor Museum](https://www.lakelandmotormuseum.co.uk),
which has a lot of exhibits to see.  A good range of cycles to see showing the history of
development, a lot of small steps.  The hosts for the week at [Abbot Hall Hotel](https://www.christianguild.co.uk/abbothall/index.php) put on a
quiz in the evening (we didn't go to most of what they put on which was naughty) but Virginia
did well at the quiz.  I failed totally to recognise songs from the 1960s based on the first
few seconds.
