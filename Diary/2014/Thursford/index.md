We went again to see the Christmas Show at the
[Thursford Collection](https://www.thursford.com),
a long drive but worth it. We get there early to at least
have lunch before the coaches disgorge their hundreds
and it becomes difficult to move around. It's great
meeting up with my cousin there and her husband.

The show is well done, they vary it a bit year to year (so
this year we had a Norfolk bor comic and a circus performer),
it was sensibly choreographed and performed but it just didn't
thrill me as it did the first year we went. I'm jaded I know.
