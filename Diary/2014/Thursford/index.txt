	We went again to see the Christmas Show at the
	[https://www.thursford.com Thursford Collection],
	a long drive but worth it. We get there early to at least
	have lunch before the coaches disgorge their hundreds
	and it becomes difficult to move around. It's great
	meeting up with my cousin there and her husband.

	The show is well done, they vary it a bit year to year (so
	this year we had a Norfolk bor comic and a circus performer),
	it was sensibly choreographed and performed but it just didn't
	thrill me as it did the first year we went. I'm jaded I know.
