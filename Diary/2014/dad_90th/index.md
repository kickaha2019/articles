The weather was fine as my father explored the grounds of
[Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill)
by means of one of their mobility scooters.  He went so far
I was worried how late we would get back!  We rounded off the
afternoon in the cafeteria there, finding plenty of space
despite the coaches visiting.
