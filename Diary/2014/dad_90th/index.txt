	The weather was fine as my father explored the grounds of
	[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill Anglesey Abbey] 
	by means of one of their mobility scooters.  He went so far
	I was worried how late we would get back!  We rounded off the
	afternoon in the cafeteria there, finding plenty of space
	despite the coaches visiting.
