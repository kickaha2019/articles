Virginia has been eyeing up the bathroom for a while as a suitable case for treatment,
and its time came this September. Cats were boarded at their usual cattery, and we readied
ourselves to be facility challenged.

The epochs of one corner of the bathroom - it seemed geological at the time.

Our friends Christine and Jonathan very kindly offered us hospitality
as our house wasn't quite its normal self.

At the time a dramatic changing of seasons but we'll take it all for
granted in a week or two!
