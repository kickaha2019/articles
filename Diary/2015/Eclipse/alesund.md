At 3am in the morning we were awoken by kettles and telephones and
bottles flying around the cabin. A storm the captain had told us about
the evening before had persisted and grown into a Force 12 hurricane
which we all felt as he turned the ship to approach Alesund. Good stuff,
want to know one is on a ship at the mercy of the elements.

We did our first excursion to Giske and God&oslash;y with oddly people
of Scottish extraction as guide and driver!  Alesund is in a complex of
islands linked by bridges and particularly tunnels, some of which have been
blasted deep under the Fjords. Norway builds tunnels even for a few school children
to get to skule. Dusty as cars have iron studs in their tyres for snow.
A man walked illegally along one such tunnel, the coach driver honked and
we later saw police going to arrest him.

Giske Church was interesting. Pre-reformation it was Catholic, the Church had
kissing crosses on it which pilgrims could kiss to get 100 days of time off purgatory.
Post-reformation it became Lutheran. A notable called *Altarpiece Jacob*
carved the current ornate altarpiece and pulpit, and even painted them with his blend
of paints. I saw that the 2 on the hymn numbers was more like a 9.
A lot of surnames of Giske in the graveyard.

We had squidgy cake at Alsne lighthouse, which I climbed for good views of the Atlantic
battering against the rocky beaches. Picturesque. A bay surfers use. Last stop was to look
over Alesund re-built after fire in 1905 in an Art Nouveau style. Oddly
reminiscent of Venice or Amsterdam.

The excursion was not as cold as expected!

In the evening a good show 'Oceans' by the youngish theatre company, a medley of mostly nautical related
songs. Not pretentious or artistic, just belting the numbers out.
