	The Boudicca's sister ship [Braemar]
	occupied the quayside at Leknes in the Lofoten Islands so we had to use a tender (in
	practice a lifeboat) to reach land for our excursion here. This was more interesting than
	anticipated as the tie part of tying up got imperfectly done, and the tender drifted out to sea
	before all of us were off it!

	We saw a stave Church in Buksnes constructed in 1905 when Norway got its independence, the building
	combined Christian design with Viking emblems and Norwegian pride. The priest talked about the
	Viking heads and Roman Catholic style crucifix before playing on the
	organ for us to sing "Amazing Grace".

	The excursions also took in the Viking museum at Borg, where we saw a short film and peered at
	exhibits armed with smart headsets (simple clicking to get the right description). A breezy walk to
	see a reconstructed Viking long house. I made one of my big mistakes in the shop there.
	For some arcane reason I wasted money on Viking flatbread which tasted awful,
	Virginia pointed out it was past its sell by date, and I spotted mould on it!

	The tender back to the Boudicca was choppy, and we ended up with a big gap between us and the ship.
	Some parking manoeuvres ensued! And hilarity.
