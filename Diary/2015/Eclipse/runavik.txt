	We didn't do an excursion in the Faroe Islands, just wandered ashore and admired
	a petrol station bakers and fish hanging up to dry. Some people who did a
	coach ride said there was good scenery. The Boudicca was moored right by
	the Braemar in Runavik.

	In the afternoon quiz we got our best ever score (15) thanks to sitting with
	another lady. Patriotic show entitled "Britain Rocks" in the evening included
	some flag waving, James Bond theme songs, Hope and Glory, Rule Britannia.

	Not allowed it's said to just carry our own luggage off which we've found
	useful on the P&O cruises. Also a little worried that we're on a low deck
	and may have to wait a while as the upper decks get to leave first when
	we get back to Southampton.
