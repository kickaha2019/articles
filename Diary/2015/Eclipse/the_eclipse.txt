	There was snow at 5am they said (I wasn't up then but slept in snatches due to
	the anticipation). When I looked out I could just see cloud.
	It rained. It was choppy.
	But against the odds our captain got the Boudicca into an area of patchy cloud for 9:45am
	(we had gone back to UK time),
	and the Totality was clearly visible!

	Virginia saw it up in the Observatory, I lurked on the Lido Deck. Through the eclipse glasses
	provided the night before one could see the moon slowly eating the sun. But even close to
	totality the sun was still brightness too bright to see. But suddenly as if someone had
	turned a switch or a conjuror done a trick the sun was replaced by a burning jet black moon!
	Totality lasted two to three minutes, it was bodacious.  The crew sang something, oohs and aahs,
	magic in the sky. Wild applause as the moon slipt off the sun and the full effulgence returned.

	The sea is a big place, besides the [Boudicca] Fred Olsen's [Braemar] and
	[Black Watch] were also around the Faroe Islands, and there was a P&O ship
	and other ships too. But we were alone where we were. Later on the Fred Olsen ships
	met up to sail in formation for a while.

	I had to rent an adapter to recharge my razor as its charger didn't fit the socket
	in the bathroom. Silly me. The genial waiters performed the 'Happy Birthday' rite at the
	evening meal (seemingly at the wrong table to start with). They are friendly,
	the staff try to accommodate the passengers (so Virginia got to see tomorrow's menus for
	her dairy free diet). Perhaps because it's a smaller ship the staff get to know you,
	get to know I have green tea after the evening meal, one gets to recognise them.
	Virginia admired the pens the waiters had which had small lights at the nib end,
	would have made a good souvenir!
