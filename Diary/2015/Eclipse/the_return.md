Now back in the UK!

The last few days of the cruise were slow - Sunday there was
an Interdenominational Church Service in the Neptune lounge, and the third and final
formal night. Increasingly people want to avoid being photographed, and it was
tedious queueing for the Captain's Farewell Reception (though he and the team
deserved kudos for getting us to see the eclipse). In the evening meals
Baked Alaskas with sparklers were triumphantly carried into the restaurant.
Our cabin stewardess Atitaya took part in the crew concert which had some
Asian dancing I liked to see.

Some people put their bags out a day early.

The last full day saw the passenger talent show . . . and we crammed clothes
into cases.

Cut back on the breakfast on the last day, collected spare car keys onboard
which were slightly damaged, then didn't have to wait as long as feared before
we could join in a confused scrum to find our offloaded bags. Didn't have to
show our passports which was strange. Easy journey back apart from Macdonalds
near Baldock doing an awful imitation of a cup of chocolate.
