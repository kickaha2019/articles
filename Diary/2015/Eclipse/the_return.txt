	Now back in the UK!

	The last few days of the cruise were slow - Sunday there was
	an Interdenominational Church Service in the Neptune lounge, and the third and final
	formal night. Increasingly people want to avoid being photographed, and it was
	tedious queueing for the Captain's Farewell Reception (though he and the team
	deserved kudos for getting us to see the eclipse). In the evening meals
	Baked Alaskas with sparklers were triumphantly carried into the restaurant.
	Our cabin stewardess Atitaya took part in the crew concert which had some
	Asian dancing I liked to see.

	Some people put their bags out a day early.

	The last full day saw the passenger talent show . . . and we crammed clothes
	into cases.

	Cut back on the breakfast on the last day, collected spare car keys onboard
	which were slightly damaged, then didn't have to wait as long as feared before
	we could join in a confused scrum to find our offloaded bags. Didn't have to
	show our passports which was strange. Easy journey back apart from Macdonalds
	near Baldock doing an awful imitation of a cup of chocolate.
