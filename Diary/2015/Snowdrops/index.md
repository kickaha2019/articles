There are various rituals which mark the turning of a year for me.
I can think of my own birthday halfway through the year, I can
think of Christmas and New Year of course which is a busier family time.
Virginia would be unhappy if I failed to mention
St Valentine's Day which we now tend to observe at the
*Phoenix* in Histon, one day out so it's more relaxed.

The less common rituals are those like the
*Tufty Club Outing* held on the last Thursday in July, or
the [fireworks](http://www.hisimp.net/wp/histon-and-impington-fireworks-extgravaganza-2014/)
at Impington Village College which begin the season of winter. And what's
becoming our annual pilgrimage to Thursford for their
[Thursford Christmas Spectacular](https://www.thursford.com/christmas-spectacular/).

We begin the year with seeing the snowdrops at
[Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill).
A pleasant stroll in an other-worldly place, slightly
removed from the stressful society we inhabit. Doors in walls make
me think fondly of "The Silver Chair".
