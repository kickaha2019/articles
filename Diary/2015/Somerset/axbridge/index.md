Our long weekend started with a stressful journey to Axbridge through the heart of
Coventry. The Satnav meant kindly probably, meaning to miss congestion, but I would
happily have missed the feeling of doom I get from driving around lost inside a
big city. A bad start. We stopped at a service station down the A46, I had a mulled apple
drink at a neat [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.co.uk/) at Warwick Budbrooke,
and we refuelled.

The rest of the journey including the M5 wasn't bad, but finding our holiday hideaway
the [Parsonage](http://www.the-parsonage-axbridge.co.uk) was. It was hidden away up a rough steep stony track the car protested traversing,
the sign only saying Wells 10 miles. Tricky. The house itself was very appealing, full of
character and narrow windy staircases. A 21-year old cat Rosie sat on the back of a chair.
The friendly proprietress did full English breakfast in a dainty ornamented breakfast
room. A great view down to the nearby reservoir. Not a lot of parking space, slight
challenge reversing the car to get back down the trail in. We didn't get a key for the
room which caused me perhaps unnecessary unease.

We ate in Axbridge itself at the [Lamb Inn](https://www.butcombe.com/pubs/the-lamb-hotel/), I admired its
charm and antiquity and oak beams as I had a Butcombe Ale pie.
