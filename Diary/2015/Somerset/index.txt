	Our long weekend started with a stressful journey to Axbridge through the heart of
	Coventry. The Satnav meant kindly probably, meaning to miss congestion, but I would
	happily have missed the feeling of doom I get from driving around lost inside a
	big city. A bad start. We stopped at a service station down the A46, I had a mulled apple
	drink at a neat [https://www.starbucks.co.uk/ Starbucks] at Warwick Budbrooke,
	and we refuelled.

	The rest of the journey including the M5 wasn't bad, but finding our holiday hideaway
	the [http://www.the-parsonage-axbridge.co.uk Parsonage] was. It was hidden away up a rough steep stony track the car protested traversing,
	the sign only saying Wells 10 miles. Tricky. The house itself was very appealing, full of
	character and narrow windy staircases. A 21-year old cat Rosie sat on the back of a chair.
	The friendly proprietress did full English breakfast in a dainty ornamented breakfast
	room. A great view down to the nearby reservoir. Not a lot of parking space, slight
	challenge reversing the car to get back down the trail in. We didn't get a key for the
	room which caused me perhaps unnecessary unease.

	We ate in Axbridge itself at the [https://www.butcombe.com/pubs/the-lamb-hotel/ Lamb Inn], I admired its
	charm and antiquity and oak beams as I had a Butcombe Ale pie.

	The next day (23rd October)
	after a good full English breakfast we survived the stress of weird road systems to get to
	Cheddar Gorge, and the purse survived the stress of the sizeable entrance fee for
	[https://www.cheddargorge.co.uk/explore/goughs-cave Gough's Cave]. We were happily an early
	customer so wandered the echoey caverns without the happy sound of children hunting us.
	At Cheddar Gorge they handed out handsets with numbered narration for the various
	places, I didn't listen really. Damp, algae and lichen and even weeds growing in the
	artificial light. Beautiful flows of calcite, magical pools mirrors.

	Right at the lowest point a helpful guide confirmed I had seen a bat, showed how translucent
	the stalagmites were with a green laser pointer, turned down the lights so we could see how
	little the original discoverers saw. Cheddar Gorge cave had some cheese being cave matured,
	we got some in the shops outside the caverns when we exited - we could have bought a wheel
	of cheese for &pound;340 but it would take us years to eat it! Odd was a politically correct
	museum which argued that cannibalism is quite reasonable really. Roast leg of insurance
	salesman anyone?

	Our lunch was less adventurous but pleasant in the nicely old
	[http://thealmshouseteashop.co.uk/ Almshouse Teashop]. We did a bit more history in the
	[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/king-johns-hunting-lodge King John Hunting Lodge] which
	as it dates from well after his time may not have much to do with him. Plenty of exhibits,
	and a panel to open to see wattle and daub (being able to see through the floorboards to the
	room below was eerie).

	It had been dry if not blazing sun, but Saturday (24th) changed that. We voyaged through
	the rain to see [https://www.the-shoe-museum.org/ Clarks Shoe Museum] in Street but they failed
	to open! In desperation we went to [https://www.wookey.co.uk/ Wookey Hole] where so long ago
	I closed my eyes rather than see the 'witch'. OK the cave had some formations to admire,
	bridges over chasms, but it was clearly aimed at the kids including wearing a white safety
	helmet and queueing for ages for a free pumpkin toy! As an adult it felt tacky and twee, to
	a child probably magical. Wookey Hole now has dinosaurs not to climb on, over-stretched staff
	to get pasties and sausage rolls (not bad) from, and a gauntlet of kiddie fun to suffer
	before you reach the exit. A long walk across sodden meadows with toy policemen at the
	pedestrian crossing completes the picture.

	In the evening we dined at [https://www.brewersfayre.co.uk/pub-restaurant/Somerset/Sidcot-Arms-Weston-Super-Mare.html Brewers Fayre], first time we had used that chain.
	Not as relaxed to order at bar instead of someone taking your order, but they fed us.
	More stress driving back in unfamiliar near dark missing turnings.

	And then Sunday (25th) and time to return. Top avoid Coventry we headed for the M4 ignoring
	the Satnav advice - but our punishment was ending up in the chaos of runners in the
	streets of Bristol! We did escape eventually and had a simple journey back along the M4 then
	M25 then A1 then A505 then A10 then M11. On the way we stopped at a Macdonalds where you
	could order at a touch sensitive screen - smart, but also dehumanising too.
