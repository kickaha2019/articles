There's a variety of sources for the text on the pages in the game proper.

Some pages have snatches of poetry or songs that often run through
my head. Songs like Gilbert and Sullivan, or Flanders and Swann, or
Simon and Garfunkel. Poetry like "Kublai Khan" by Coleridge.
There's also nursery rhymes some of which to me seem to have
Jungian archetypes embedded in them.

There are fewer quotations and excerpts from literary works, such
as Dickens or Philip Jose Farmer.

There are a number of lists as well, of entities like colours
or birds or fruit. Or authors and books by authors. These
lists help create interesting linkages between the game pages
it must be admitted.

I haven't inside the game acknowledged where the texts on the
pages come from.  Inside my head the texts exist on their own, and
often I couldn't say where they came from. A partial list of the
