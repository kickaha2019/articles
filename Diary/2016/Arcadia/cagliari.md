![Cagliari](cagliari.jpg)
We wandered into Cagliari this afternoon - bought some sweets to take back and some postcards.
One shop offered us small treats to taste so we had to buy something to discharge the
guilt. A lot of Africans either
begging or selling things. Cagliari itself is a port city, sloping hills - rich shops but
also narrow streets and holes being dug.
