	We wandered into Cagliari this afternoon - bought some sweets to take back and some postcards. 
	One shop offered us small treats to taste so we had to buy something to discharge the
	guilt. A lot of Africans either 
	begging or selling things. Cagliari itself is a port city, sloping hills - rich shops but 
	also narrow streets and holes being dug.
