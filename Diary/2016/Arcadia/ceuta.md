Ceuta (Th-Euta) and the worse excursion! Oddly for a Mediterranean cruise the ship
didn't stop at Gibraltar instead it stopped at Ceuta which is the other side of the
Straits, a Spanish enclave in Morocco.

We had a slow coach ride then got dumped in a square and
told to keep ourselves busy for 40 minutes - no mention that was the last we would see
of the coach which disappointed those who left bags on it. Then we were shepherded to see
the walls that
used to divide Ceuta from the mainland - but it was the boat ride up the southern side of
Ceuta that plumbed the depths. An inaudible commentary repeated twenty times outward,
and a deafening
series of Spanish pop songs in the way back. When we reached the quayside no
comments about make your own way to
the boat, we just fled hoping that was the end of the tour!
