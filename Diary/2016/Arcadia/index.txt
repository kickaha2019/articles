	We counted down the months. We counted down the weeks. We counted down the days. At last the 
	non-working day arrived, the day on which we had to ensure the spare bed room was sealed up so 
	Amelia couldn't hide inside it, the day on which clothes were packed in cases cluttering up
	the lounge, the day of have we got everything together?
	
	Our poor cats, Tabitha and Amelia, were transported in their carriers to the ''Grange Cattery''
	in Waterbeach and the kind care of Phyllis. The road had been improved in places, but still
	bumpy and undulating. It may be the last time they go there as Phyllis is in her 60s, and 
	the landlord has planned building works which will shut the cattery. Disturbingly (but
	necessarily I guess) Phyllis asked what to do if Tabitha died while we were away - we settled 
	for having her frozen at the vets so we could cremate her later.

	An easy drive down - Ginny drove to the [Macdonalds] at Royston where we had a drink each,
	convenient one can order at a touch-screen, then I drove to South Mimms where we favoured 
	[https://www.kfc.co.uk/ KFC]. The Satnav to my concern didn't take us down the M3, but instead the A3 which was fine
	if not better as the M3 has always had roadworks on it when we've gone along it. We were glad 
	as we arrived too early to check in to find a [https://www.harvester.co.uk/restaurants/southeast/thegreatsalternsmansionportsmouth Harvester] on the outskirts of Portsmouth at
	Great Salterns with good views of the sea. I had an apple 'bomb' which happily didn't 
	contain sultanas. 

	The Satnav lulled us into a false sense of security by navigating us safely to what I imagined
	was a B&B but proved to be the upmarket [https://www.number4hotel.co.uk/ Number 4 Boutique Hotel]. Just as well we were
	on the ground floor in room 1 as we had five cases to manhandle in from the car! A helpful
	receptionist Daga seemed miffed we didn't ask her to help with moving the cases. Instead
	of going back to the Harvester we used the free Wifi to check out nearby restaurants, and settled
	on a tapas place [https://nicholsonsrestaurant.co.uk/ Nicholsons] which was an easy walk up the street. The baked mushroom starter
	was splendid, the shared main course of paella was a little stodgy to me. 
	
	Room was hot as the heating was on, also heard noise from next room a bit. I survived the time
	by watching four episodes of [https://www.koreandrama.org/ghost-phantom/ Ghost] until we left.
