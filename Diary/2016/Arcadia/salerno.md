As elsewhere the ship docked at a container port - on the dockside were
artistic piles of aluminium railway sleepers. We were on bus 4 for the Herculaneum
tour, the stickers are not very adhesive and a fellow guest lost theirs almost
immediately. The guide Monika, who spoke English like Chico Marx pretending to be
Italian, had a marvellous umbrella with cats dressed as Tudor kings and queens.
Umbrellas and raincoats were advised today, and we got a little soaked walking back
from Herculaneum to the coach, but I failed to persuade Ginny to take a waterproof.

Herculaneum itself was tragic, a monument to a tragedy. Smaller than Pompeii,
originally by the sea and at the ancient dockside were casts of the skeletons of
victims caught while waiting for boats to rescue them. Wooden beams carbonised by the heat,
mosaics still visible, wine shops and cooking pots, home decorations, a temple
of emperor worship.
