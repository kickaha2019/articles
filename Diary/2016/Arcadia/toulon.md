![Aix En Provence](aix.jpg)
We docked at La Seyne sur Mer then after a very early breakfast caught coach 5 (moving from
coach 4 which we were at the back after they filled the coach without counting how many were on it)
to Aix en Provence. Pretty scenery with hilltop villages and vineyards (first in France
but the original grapes killed off by phyloxera worm so replaced from California and Texas).

Aix is an interesting place,
rundown mansions slowly being restored by Unesco. Apple store like a glass pavilion
on Mirabeau Avenue (Mirabeau was a dubious character who bought it during the
French Revolution). One of our
party tried sitting on a rising bollard which slowly descended under him and he slowly
fell to the ground!

Aix has artistic connections - Cezanne walked each day to paint
hills and his path is now marked by gold nails in streets. Emile Zola and Darius Milhaud
and others have plaques to them. On our tour of the artistic streets we saw
an elderly Frenchman 'park' by bashing his well damaged car
into another.

We had some free time after the walk to the cathedral, and patronised some biscuit
shops. As elsewhere being offered samples to taste forced us to buy
something to take back for work and family. The biscuit shop sold empty boxes
which you could fill yourself. We had a drink in a cafe on the Mirabeau avenue,
I admired the electrical wiring in the section we sat in.
