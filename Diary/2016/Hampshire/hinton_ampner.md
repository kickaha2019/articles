The next day after breakfast (Ginny did the eggs well done) we went to
[Hinton Ampner](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hinton-ampner), a National Trust place. Georgian style place built in the 1960s, not massive
but full of eclectic beauty and porcelain and semi-precious stones embedded into wood. Plenty
of fine topiary in the gardens but we couldn't walk far as they were afraid of the damage from
footfalls after rain. Had a dubious sausage roll - the jacket potato looked far better. Then
onto [Jane Austen's house](https://www.jane-austens-house-museum.org.uk/) at Chawton, saw the 12-sided small frail table on which she wrote and
rewrote her masterpieces. A different era. She and Cassandra left school at 11! Then onto
another kind of temple - Sainsburys in Alton to get ready meals for the evening. We played
Scrabble.
