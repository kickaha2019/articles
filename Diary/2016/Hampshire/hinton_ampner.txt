	The next day after breakfast (Ginny did the eggs well done) we went to
	[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hinton-ampner Hinton Ampner], a National Trust place. Georgian style place built in the 1960s, not massive
	but full of eclectic beauty and porcelain and semi-precious stones embedded into wood. Plenty
	of fine topiary in the gardens but we couldn't walk far as they were afraid of the damage from
	footfalls after rain. Had a dubious sausage roll - the jacket potato looked far better. Then
	onto [https://www.jane-austens-house-museum.org.uk/ Jane Austen's house] at Chawton, saw the 12-sided small frail table on which she wrote and
	rewrote her masterpieces. A different era. She and Cassandra left school at 11! Then onto
	another kind of temple - Sainsburys in Alton to get ready meals for the evening. We played
	Scrabble.
