A far smoother trip into Portsmouth on the Tuesday and straight into the best car park
which had plenty of space. A ripoff price of &pound;32 for all the attractions, but having come
so far not much option. We did HMS Warrior first and then HMS Victory - both very similar,
and very different. Both had tiers of gundecks, small kitchens and surgeries and stores.
HMS Warrior both more modern and more headroom, locker-room like areas holding the kitbags.
HMS Warrior also had engines in it which were turning like the heart of the world.
Also did a museum displaying figureheads upstairs, quite a range.

On the way back to East Meon we stopped at the [Seven Stars](https://www.sevenstarsstroud.co.uk/) at Stroud for a decent lunch.
The shared bread was OK but not the best, main meal reasonably priced, very friendly staff,
well laid out, toilets great. Downside was one noisy woman intent on sharing what she thought of
various films and TV with everyone else in the restaurant including plot twists. I felt like
recommending "Dread" to her.
