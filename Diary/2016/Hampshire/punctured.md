We returned to Winchester on Monday 14th, discovering Ginny's near side front tyre had a
slow puncture so called breakdown people out later on return to East Meon.
Winchester was a nightmare of closed streets and car parks and attractions like
King Arthur's round table. Happily easy to walk around, smaller area than Marwell Zoo.
Saw the imposing [cathedral](https://www.winchester-cathedral.org.uk/), with Jane Austen's tomb and ornate stonework and
monuments to the dead. An alive place of active worship which is good. Schoolgirl party
blocked off seeing an old illustrated manuscript Bible for a while. We hit a Sainsburys and
Marks & Spencer's for supplies.

Green Flag came soon after we called them in the afternoon - detecting the spare tyre was
cracked, and a nail in the current front tyre. So off to Petersfield.
[Petersfield Exhaust and Tyre Services](https://portsmouthgarageservices.co.uk/) fixed the tyre for a reasonable price, &pound;17.95 to my surprise! I felt dumb afterwards
having let them have Ginny's house keys to be able to drive the car into their workshop.
But at least a working tyre now!
