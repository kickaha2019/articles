On the last full day we got to [Uppark](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/uppark-house-and-garden) only just in time for a taster tour of the house at 11am
- the NT website is rather out of step with what's happening on the ground. I found what was
below the stairs (splendid housekeeper's room, safe for silverware, kitchens, wine cellar,
nooks and crannies) much more interesting than the usual upstairs rooms of pictures and china.
Uppark House is stood like Darien on his promontory, looking out across rolling valleys. A
subterranean complex of tunnels linked the house with the two service buildings for cooking etc,
Ginny found it quite a labyrinth. Damp too.

Uppark had a HG Wells connection, his mother was an unsuccessful housekeeper here (got sacked
in the end), HG Wells used the house for a book, he even played with the elaborate dolls house
that a Fetherston-Haugh bride brought with her to the house. We had jacket potatoes - had to send
them back as got tuna rather cheese first time round.

We then eventually found [Butser Ancient Farm](http://www.butserancientfarm.co.uk/) despite the satnav (which also betrayed us again
into a gauntlet of one-track roads to return to East Meon rather than straightforward faster
motorways). It had already been discovered by several coach loads of school children -
whose nap sacks laid around the reconstructed roundhouses. Either that or the Anglo-Saxons
were more advanced than I give them credit for. I found the wattle and daub more interesting
than the Roman villa ready with do it yourself mosaics for the kids.

Dined again at [Seven Stars](https://www.sevenstarsstroud.co.uk/), liked the jam pudding with custard.
