	On the Sunday we navigated to a car park in Winchester with only a hiccup or two, but were baffled
	how to enter [http://winbap.org.uk/ Winchester Baptist Church] until one of the congregation took pity on us. Most of the
	people were away but there were still enough there for a good service. I found it difficult to cope
	with having a not quite with it woman behind me who coughed and sang wildly.

	Virginia and I made a big mistake for lunch, going into an Art Cafe. The student type looked at us
	as if we were stupid, and didn't help at all - we should have walked out but instead got mugged for a
	miserable sandwich unaccompanied by crisps or salad. Silly us.

	We also shouldn't have gone to the [https://www.winchestersciencecentre.org/ Winchester Science Museum] - really one for the kids. We sat through
	a show on the creation of the universe from a Big Bang theory - most people get what they believe
	from what they hear most often, they couldn't derive what they believe from first principles. For us
	a waste of money but for the kids plenty to play with.

	We then had a lot of exercise walking around the extensive [https://www.marwell.org.uk/zoo/ Marwell Zoo]. It had tigers and cheetahs
	and leopards, all perhaps bored witless but at least at less risk than in their native habitats. Our
	feet were sore afterwards.

	In the evening we dined at the [https://www.thethomaslord.co.uk/ Thomas Lord] pub in West Meon.
	He was the Lord of Lord's cricket ground, explaining the cricket themed adornment.
	Upmarket fare, the desserts were more artistic than filling. A dog friendly place,
	they had a water bowl down for the canines. A door bell rang when the kitchen had dishes
	ready for the waiting staff to take through to the tables. But pleasant atmosphere, a
	solid village presence.
