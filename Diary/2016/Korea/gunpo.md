A driver with a car came just as I was about to check with the Korean travel firm, and off
we set to Gunpo city, and to find where teacher Kim lived in the Sanbon district. The driver
had to chat with someone driving a small van, and also to ring teacher Kim, before we
arrived at the right tower block in a grove of tower blocks. Teacher Kim has a large two storey
apartment at the top of one of these tower blocks which he uses to put up the foreign students who
attend his Baduk academy [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/). I luckily had a room to myself as the
student whose room it was studies in Seoul during the week.

It's a short walk from the apartment to the [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/), it was only by the last day
of my stay that I knew the twists and turns to take! One does self study at [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/)
before 2pm when the teachers arrive, I had a kind of breakfast / lunch at a chain called
*Paris Baguette* of some pastries and green tea
(found the iced green tea best as the hot tea was too hot in the already hot weather in
Sanbon - glad I wasn't there in summer when temperatures are in the high thirties).
There were multiple *Paris Baguette* stores in Sanbon just as there were multiple 7-11s,
less than a hundred yards apart! English is less established in Sanbon than Seoul but
I managed as necessary by pointing. There seemed to be eateries and shops everywhere
you looked in Sanbon, many quite upmarket like the cake shops.

![BIBA entrance](biba1.jpg)
[BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/) mainly teaches youngsters, both boys and girls. The stronger students don't attend
normal school at all, but study Baduk all the time. I was very puzzled by this coming
from the UK where this wouldn't be allowed - it is a problem for those who don't make
the professional grade. At the apartment but also at [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/) one takes one's shoes off,
at [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/) there is a supply of slippers at the door.

I played several games at [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/), usually losing by miles. It's salutary playing a
young kid, getting obliterated, and then him telling you how badly one played. I also
studied opening positions, and got some way through a set of tsume-go problems. It was
quite hot inside [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/), I sometimes would go out for fresh air and once had an iced
blue coloured lemonade drink. A treat watching them halve a real lemon, squeeze it
into a plastic cup, add blue colouring, then put into a machine which chilled it
and sealed it, then pierce the top with a thick straw.

![Barbecuing at Sanbon restaurant](sanbon_barbecue.jpg)
I ate out on the nights in Sanbon with people from [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/), very sociable. The first night
was at a barbecue place where you cook the food yourselves using a grill in the table. The
heat from the coals under the grill made me feel unwell. Following Korean tradition the
youngest person does the cooking, as we were using chopsticks there was a pair of scissors
provided to cut the meat. The second night three of us went to a Korean flavoured Japanese
restaurant, but later on that evening a larger group of us went to a 'pub' with loud music
and packing crate decor where we had pineapple flavoured soju. The third night the same
three of us went to another barbecue cook it yourself place (called Dino Meat) where we
sat on the floor, and you could press buzzers on the tables to call the waitresses.
We being there amused the staff a lot.

We would then return to the apartment around 10pm - even at that time you would see
children in school uniform. A lot of long suffering children have to go to cram schools, there was one
next door to [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/). The last night I was there Teacher Kim cooked some very hot noodles, I could
just about eat them but my lips burned for a while afterwards. His family were watching the
Korean TV drama "Entertainer" on a very large TV.
