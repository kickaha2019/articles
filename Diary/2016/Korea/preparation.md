title: 1:Why South Korea

Sometimes the start, the cause, the trigger is hard to write down. Perhaps it was watching the Korean TV
dramas I was doing which provoked me to want to visit South Korea. Dramas like "The Greatest Love" and
"Master's Sun" - I'm now watching more Chinese and Japanese TV dramas but that's by the by. Perhaps it
was convincing myself I'm steadily getting worse at playing Go, and thinking visiting a Korean Go school
for foreigners might fix some of my foibles. Perhaps it was a yearning for the exotic.

I surveyed travel agencies which seemed they might be able to provide me with a custom itinerary of
seeing sights,
but also taking in a few days at a Baduk academy [BIBA](http://www.bibabaduk.net/) I found on the web.
I plumped for [Wexas](https://www.wexas.com/) (on no profound reasoning),
and starting exchanging emails with Debbie there.
We arrived at a date which the Baduk academy said was OK, and so I started planning the holiday
(which is a part I enjoy, sometimes being on the holiday itself can be stressful). The planning
involved minor details like how to get to and from Heathrow, sorting out how much money to take,
ensuring I had days of holiday free to take from work.
