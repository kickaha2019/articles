I dreamt about how I was back at work, but couldn't remember the flight at all, or
taking the coach back to Cambridge, at all, or if I had collected my suitcase at Heathrow! Then
I awoke and I was still in Korea. The same driver who took me to Gunpo then took me to
Incheon through numerous toll gates. At Incheon airport I spent the Korean won I hadn't used
on food to take back, and also a scarf for Virginia and a tie that just appealed to me even
though I barely wear ties now. My carry on bag was beginning to worryingly bulge by the end.
A long uncomfortable flight of 11 hours, the plane wasn't as modern as the one I came on,
I gave up trying to watch anything on the small lowres screen in the screen in front of me.

At Heathrow I was relieved to see that I was well within the &pound;390 limit for nothing to declare
which had worried me after I bought stuff at Incheon, and I just made it through all the
formalities to get onto a 7.05pm coach for Norwich! By seconds! And I had got the right
ticket for once! The coach only stopped once at Stansted before my stop.

And sadly back to ordinary mundane life.
