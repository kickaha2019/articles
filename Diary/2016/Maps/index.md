My efforts at game-making have become less ambitious over the years.
This current project was to do a present hunt for Virginia, where she
followed a paper-trail to find where her birthday (it turned out to be
Christmas) present was. The twist being the paper-chase is in the
virtual world not the real one.

I used [Google maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/web/) to able to click on locations to visit. Really
kind of Google to provide such a facility for free. At each location
there are some pictures. The menu lets you see a welcome page,
the current clue, or the map. Nothing too elaborate.

(Update in March 2020: this game is currently broken, Google started
charging for use of their Map API in the way this game uses it.)
