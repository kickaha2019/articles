Time for the [Thursford Christmas Spectacular](https://www.thursford.com/christmas-spectacular/) again!
This year we almost didn't make it as we both fell ill with streaming noses and coughs and
colds. But such is our dedication to starting the Christmas season properly we forced
ourselves to go. Virginia drove (which I find stressful as she drives rather differently to
the way I do) and for once the Satnav didn't play us foul, and we reached Thursford in
an hour and a three quarters.

We ate at the cafe in [Thursford Fantasy Land](https://www.thursford.com/santas-magical-journey/)
for a change. Pretty much the same unmagical food as the other venues, the soup had to be microwaved as
it wasn't even lukewarm. In this venue they give you a table number and bring the food to
you. Santa's Magical Journey looked pretty much like it did last year, in fact Thursford as
a whole did though there is a new toy shop there.

We killed the time before 2pm by squeezing through the bustle in the shops (the coaches had
arrived and unloaded by this point), sat on the carousel for a drink, then took our seats. We like to sit
at the back where you're not trapped in. The extra seating they put in for the show is a bit cramped
and awkward where people come late and have to apologise their way to their seats.

The show was a feast for the eyes as much as the ears, a lot going on on the stage.
The variety turn was a couple of Japanese adept at balancing and spinning various things.
The comedian was pretty clean - a pleasant change from the obscenity equals humour of
modern days. I enjoyed the first half - just more variety. The doves continued to fly at the
end of the performance. It was the 40th so looking back.

After the show we were fortunate to meet up with my cousin Pat and her husband
Richard in the marquee for a bite to eat before we left. We had thought they weren't going to
be able to make this year when we were there.

A dirty drive home with the windscreen dirtied by spray. I was glad to be able mostly
to sit on other people's tails and follow their red lights home.
