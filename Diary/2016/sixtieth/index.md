![The Holiday Inn](holiday_inn.jpg)
A quiet and pleasant Sunday afternoon, with family and fellow Church members and friends I hadn't
seen for a while, in commiseration for my upcoming 60th birthday. We held the celebration at
the [Cambridge Holiday Inn](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/gb/en/cambridge/cbgim/hoteldetail) hotel in Histon where we live,
they provided the nicely laid out Trinity Room, a more than ample buffet, and water
and orange juice on the five tables - and we added balloons and a banner.  The balloons hung upside
so they read "09" rather than "60", but I didn't mind. We didn't have helium or hydrogen to fill
them. Virginia did one of her cakes, combining my fondnesses for the Peanuts cartoons and classic
Dr Who. I didn't manage to have any of it - I was too full on the day itself and it got thrown away as
too dry afterwards.

There was plenty of food left over, we ordered a buffet from the hotel without realising
how much of it there was going to be. Had to check which dishes were vegetarian for my
friend and old work colleague Simon, something to remember next time around. I did gain cards
and a few presents to be opened on the day itself. We also gained some lilies which we'll
have to be careful with as lilies are poisonous to cats.

Do I feel any wiser having reached sixty? No. Perhaps that is wisdom in itself. In a world with
so much noise, so many distractions, so many voices shouting loud the challenge is to focus. To
get along with the people you do get along with and not those you're never going to get along with.
To sit where you're comfortable and not sit where you're ill at ease. To ignore the disturbing
clamour of those competing for attention. To live where one is.
