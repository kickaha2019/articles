We went to see the impressive [Frederiksborg Castle](http://dnm.dk/uk/forside.htm)
in Hellir&oslash;d which had to be rebuilt after a monarch set it alight because his mistress felt cold.
An important place for Denmark and its nobility - the large chapel had plaques for people
honoured by Denmark.
The gardens made me think of Wonderland in [Once Upon A Time](https://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time).

We also saw the outside of
[Kronborg Castle](http://kongeligeslotte.dk/en/palaces-and-gardens/kronborg-castle.html)
which became Elsinore for Shakespeare's "Hamlet" despite the historical Hamlet living
centuries earlier. The Shakespeare 'connection' is well emphasized. The area is
adjusting to life after heavy industry.

We also had a quick visit to try and see
the [Little Mermaid](https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/little-mermaid-gdk586951)
despite a lot of competing tourists. Happily she was her normal colour after various
acts of recent vandalisation.
