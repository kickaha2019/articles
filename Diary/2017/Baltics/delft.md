We had a manic comedian as a local guide who took us to a coffee place
in Delft's main square, where there is a market seemingly of pottery more artistic
than useful. He took some of us on an optional
walk round the city, explaining the locks on the canals which prevent
the damage from buildings drying out as well as history like William of
Orange being assassinated by a Frenchman.

And then the tour went on to the
[Porcelain Flask](https://www.royaldelft.com/en_gb/), the last proper Delft
pottery, to see a porcelain
version of Rembrandt's "Night Watch", and for us to buy a pair of bowls and spoons
for our Chinese takeaways. Strange how all the attractions have gift shops
handy for souvenirs to be purchased.
