	We had a manic comedian as a local guide who took us to a coffee place
	in Delft's main square, where there is a market seemingly of pottery more artistic
	than useful. He took some of us on an optional
	walk round the city, explaining the locks on the canals which prevent
	the damage from buildings drying out as well as history like William of
	Orange being assassinated by a Frenchman.

	And then the tour went on to the
	[https://www.royaldelft.com/en_gb/ Porcelain Flask], the last proper Delft
	pottery, to see a porcelain
	version of Rembrandt's "Night Watch", and for us to buy a pair of bowls and spoons
	for our Chinese takeaways. Strange how all the attractions have gift shops
	handy for souvenirs to be purchased.
