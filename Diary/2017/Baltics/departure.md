![Church at Manor Park Farm](manor_1.JPG)
Virginia and I stayed the night before the cruise at the [Holiday Inn Express Southampton M27](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/southampton/soabr/hoteldetail), eating out at a
nearby [Pizza Hut](https://www.pizzahut.co.uk/restaurants/find-a-hut/southampton/hedge-end/).
Tabitha and Amelia had been parked in Hardwick at the
the [Angelite Cats Hotel](https://www.angelitecatshotel.co.uk/). On the Friday morning we
spent the time by seeing [Manor Park Farm](https://www.hants.gov.uk/thingstodo/countryparks/manorfarm) which has a long access lane with plenty of
enthusiastic speed bumps. There's a quaint small old Church near a romantic pond,
an old style house with an
old style school room (back in the days where you learnt multiplication tables). Animals
can be milked among other attractions for the young. After lunch there it was time to board our
first Cunard ship, the [Queen Elizabeth](https://www.cunard.co.uk/cruise-ships/queen-elizabeth/).

The first difference to our previous cruises with [P&O](https://www.pocruises.com/) and [Fred Olsen](https://www.fredolsencruises.com/)
was how fast we boarded. When we arrived at
the [Ocean Cruise Terminal](https://www.cruisesouthampton.com/places/ocean-cruise-terminal) we were
immediately directed to lane 2 for unloading our luggage - and then immediately directed
to check in on entering the cruise terminal - and then immediately through security onto the
ship! Happenstance? I don't know. One of Virginia's cases lost its luggage labels and didn't turn up for a while, but our
pleasant hard-working cabin stewardess Virna tracked it down for us. The staff work very hard and
long hours - I noted one vacuuming with the vacuum cleaner on her back.

There was more of a mix of nationalities on board - we had an Arab captain and plenty of
American and German and other passengers. The Americans did complain about the ethnocentric
bias of the quizzes which we enjoyed doing, particularly enjoying those led by a Lancashire lass Laura who was fun.
Passenger density seemed less than other ships, the theatre always seemed to have space,
good banking in the stalls which was just as well as upstairs the protective plastic distorted
the view. They showed films in the theatre which worked well, but not the Shakespeare plays
we were half expecting. The entertainment was similar to [P&O](https://www.pocruises.com/) and [Fred Olsen](https://www.fredolsencruises.com/). A talented
pianist [Maria Marchant](http://www.mariamarchant.com/) did several performances in the multiple use
Queens Room. The ship felt to me of an older style, decor-wise, the luxury feel of suited attendants
welcoming you with a harpist playing.

Cunard checked the room cards (both ours stopped working
during the cruise a common occurrence) at the muster drill. They also
use dollars on board which makes the final accounts more frightening. Perhaps spending dollars
may encourage more spending if you remember when it was 3 dollars to the pound?

![Vanilla souffle on Queen Elizabeth](ship_souffle.JPG)
Cunard didn't have casual wear in the evenings unlike other cruise lines. We were on the early
evening sitting in the Britannia restaurant and had a very good table, really friendly table
companions. Table 600 had good views but for me the sun was a problem there, and also people
were walking past on the promenade deck (some even running). The waiters were adroit with the
lemons, squeezing them into a spoon and then pouring lemon juice from the spoon. There was
no arguing if you complained about a dish, you would be offered a replacement.
We went to
the [Verandah](https://www.cunard.co.uk/cruise-ships/queen-elizabeth/dining-bars-lounges/) twice for great elaborate meals, I particularly recommend the vanilla souffle.
No crispy fried bread in the morning which I missed. There were a number of places one
could eat, we had fish and chips in the 'pub' on the last day.

Our cabin was fine though during port days there was a lot of noise from them testing lifeboats
etc. We didn't do a lot of shopping on board, had to get a sewing kit for Virginia to
temporarily repair my glasses which lost a screw - and we also got some napkin rings from
the Russian bazaar cum scrum.
