St. Petersburg was the centre of our cruise, a place of contrasts. In the city
potholed roads and delapidated buildings which contrasted with the neat new motorway
running past luxury hotels to
the ideally restored [Catherine's Palace](http://www.saint-petersburg.com/pushkin/catherine-palace/).
The beauty and splendour of [Catherine's Palace](http://www.saint-petersburg.com/pushkin/catherine-palace/) contrasted with the vile corruption of
the Romanov tsars. The guide skirted softly over the way the Nazis damaged the palace during
the siege of Leningrad.

Virginia and I also went to the [Faberg&eacute; Museum](https://fabergemuseum.ru/)
in St. Petersburg, having to walk some way due to the bad traffic. The museum only
has some of the eggs, which were interesting to see but not amazing. Perhaps I
expected them to be more elaborate intricate puzzles, but as jewellery most were
beyond expensive. The museum has other exhibits worth
seeing, jade and silver ware. In both places we wore plastic shoe covers, and weren't
allowed bottles of water inside. The Faberg&eacute; tour also went to the
[Pushkin Art Gallery](http://www.pushkin-art.com/) where the items and their prices
could be admired - I was tempted by a lacqueur box depicting an elderly cat teaching
kittens about mice but the price was $800. We had a photo stop at
[St Isaacs Cathedral](http://www.saint-petersburg.com/cathedrals/st-isaacs-cathedral/)
where I saw a bridal couple getting photographed. Brides and grooms go round
the city to be snapped on the day. Divorce rate here is 75%.

It took a long time getting through Russian border controls both ways. When there
are queues the first queue is quickest as they let that queue use the booths for
the opposite directions. The officer when I was returning second time kept saying some
Russian to me and not letting me back out - in the end I found she wanted
my boarding card.

We avoided some of the fun that our fellow passengers had on other longer tours.
One poor elderly man got mugged (could happen in any big city I know). Trips on
dubious hydrofoils more like Tupolevs on skis. Unfriendly guides who refused
comfort stops for elderly visitors. And being on the ship we had a good view
of a Russian submarine which entered the cruise ship dock perhaps seeking
a good way to celebrate the impending Russian naval day. A tug boat had to
push it away.
