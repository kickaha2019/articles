I'm an [Abba](https://abbasite.com/) fan so I was happy that Virginia and I went to the
[Abba museum](http://www.abbathemuseum.com/en/) in
Stockholm, next to a Tivoli-ish fun fair. Nostalgic and a welcome change to
seeing castles and museums.

I did learn details which everyone else probably already knew about Abba and its
history. I also got postcards there which I sent back home.

I still listen to music by Abba among others when I need to drown noise at work.
