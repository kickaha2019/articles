Text:
	I'm an [https://abbasite.com/ Abba] fan so I was happy that Virginia and I went to the
	[http://www.abbathemuseum.com/en/ Abba museum] in
	Stockholm, next to a Tivoli-ish fun fair. Nostalgic and a welcome change to
	seeing castles and museums.

	I did learn details which everyone else probably already knew about Abba and its
	history. I also got postcards there which I sent back home.

	I still listen to music by Abba among others when I need to drown noise at work.
