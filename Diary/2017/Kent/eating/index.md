We ate three times at the [Goudhurst Inn](http://www.thegoudhurstinn.com/), the first time on Saturday evening having to park
at the overflow car park at the Primary School. Finding our way back there in the darkness
(Kent seems to be economising on street lamps) was a challenge and dangerous. A busy inn on
the Saturday due to people watching rugby. The inn specialises in pizzas, I had pizza for two
of the meals there. Their meal had cottage pie with wonky vegetables so I had to have that
one night, the vegetables didn't seem wonky to me! There was an apple crumble dessert with
hazelnut which was crunchy. On summer nights there would be great views over the valley. By the end of
our stay we knew the roads enough not to need the Satnav to get there and back.

We had a Sunday lunch at the [Green Cross Inn](https://www.greencrossinn.co.uk/) - the meal was fine,
an odd feeling though being there of almost intruding. At first we were the only diners while
staff chatted among themselves, but then the place filled up with apparently local regulars
who knew the people running it well. That morning we attended
[Pembury Baptist Church](http://www.pemburybaptistchurch.org/) where we had a very warm welcome,
people very friendly. The Pembury streets were converted into one track roads thanks to car
parking along them, hard to get around. We learn that Goudhurst is said "Gaudhurst" unlike what we
had been saying! Sermon was on James which we had been studying in home group.
