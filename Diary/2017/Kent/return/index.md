Holidays can be very stressful, and problems with getting around on the roads stressed me out
this time. A foretaste was trying to get into and out of Lakeside, but what did for me was the
Satnav favouring one track roads - I can't cope with miles of driving along one track roads
worrying about meeting oncoming vehicles. The fun didn't stop with leaving Kent - a slow drive back
round London to Cambridge, and we narrowly missed trouble on the M6 on our way to stay at
the [Ramada Hotel](http://www.ramadasolihullhotel.co.uk/) in Solihull so we could attend a surprise 50th do at the
[Kings Arms](https://www.thekingsarmsknowle.co.uk/) in Knowle for our friend Yvonne. Returning from the do late at night to the hotel was
a nightmare - road closures forced a detour which ended up facing a flooded road! Happily
wisdom overruled stupidity and I didn't attempt to drive through the water. But backing up the
car in the darkness so I could try to turn it around was close to panic. The Satnav for once
behaved and found us another way back to the hotel. Returning to Cambridge the next day was
almost as bad - the M6 was blocked and we had to take a tedious scenic tour round Coventry.
