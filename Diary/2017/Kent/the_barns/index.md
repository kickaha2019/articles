It was quicker over the Queen Elizabeth Bridge on the way to Kent than ever before, we wait and see how
well the Dart charges go as the old toll-booths have gone replaced by a snapping
licence plate scheme. We found [Etchinghall Barn](http://cranbrook.kent-towns.co.uk/directory/22509/etchinghill-barn/) with the normal amount of fun. It's a
lovely and spacious place, the lounge has one wall all window looking out onto a patio and
garden. Some of the doors have a strange lock with a pull cord on the inside to free the
lock which is a wooden tongue falling into a groove. If the cord broke you would be well and
truly trapped - Ginny and I were confused by how it worked at first. The Barn has a farmyard gate
to get through but it didn't seem to be on a working farm - the owners have a very big
house and kindly checked on how we were doing. There was wifi available which came
in very useful for arranging meals and hotels and keeping in touch.

Our holiday cottage has among the crockery two William Hartnell mugs listing his first and
last utterances as Doctor Who. It also has some Christian books, some books perhaps
left by Dutch visitors. I read a historical romance by Georgette Heyer and will try more.
The barn was converted into the holiday cottage we were in plus a games room
for the family only - happily they didn't use it yet while we were there.
Virginia read her way through the visitors' book which was interesting, some observations
have been addressed since they were made.

The charger saga continued that evening - the second time I plugged the new charger in
there was a flash and it stopped working! Happily Virginia had brought two chargers with USB
connections - tried the first one, the iPad recognised something had connected,
there was a heart-warming beep . . . But no charging!
In desperation tried her second charger and this one miraculously did work!
