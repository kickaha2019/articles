We made full use of our [National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/) membership -
we saw [Bodiam Castle](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/bodiam-castle) (a fine castle ruin
with a decent sized moat where Virginia used to be taken by
her father when young), and also [Bateman's](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/batemans)
owned by Rudyard Kipling whose daughter ended up at
[Wimpole Hall](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wimpole-estate).
At [Bodiam Castle](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/bodiam-castle) we had to wear wristbands - I put mine on with difficulty,
almost sticking the paper to me rather than to itself. When it came to try to remove it I
couldn't tear it apart! Had to wrestle it over my wrist and off.
We had pea and ham soup at [Bateman's](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/batemans), a pretty place but not a lot else apart from the house.
On the way back Ginny drove and a bird shat on me through the open window! Some aiming that.

The weather was mixed - it was damp which dampened the experience of seeing
[Sissinghurst Castle Gardens](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sissinghurst-castle-garden).
The [National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/) have arranged the place strangely, you come to a small cafe and bookshop first,
where they leave the doors open so you feel the draft - but there's a much better cafe further on
where we had baked potatoes for lunch. The gardens were ornate and styled - the buildings
owned by socialites. Interesting seeing book repairers at work. One day it just tipped
down constantly and we stayed indoors apart from venturing out for food.

It was a fine day however, a nice sunny day and warm when we navigated through Tunbridge
Wells to get to [Groombridge Place](https://www.groombridgeplace.com/), which was seemingly
in its off season, or not open to visitors. Neat formal gardens, we also had a long walk
along a canal then through the
Enchanted Forest (to the eyes of a child enchanted). The house itself was private, moated,
scenic. We then voyaged to the popular [Scotney Castle](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/scotney-castle), and had a bite to eat before
touring the house (last owner was a lover of cats) and a little of the gardens. We didn't go as
far as the Castle itself down in the valley and undergoing repairs. Eclectic set of books on the
multidinous shelves.
