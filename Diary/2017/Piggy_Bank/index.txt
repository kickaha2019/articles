Title:
	Perishing piggy banks

Text:
	Being a piggy bank may seem like a cushy life. Sit on a shelf and be admired.
	Be fed regularly with nice shiny coins. Feel one's self worth increase as one's
	weight increases. Almost as easy as being a manager in a modern multi-national
	company where the only thing you have to manage is what your superior thinks of
	you.

	Alas the regularity of sitting on a shelf, and receiving offerings, may blind
	piggy banks as to their place in the grand scheme of things. The worshippers do
	not worship piggy banks themselves, they worship what they hope the contents of
	the piggy bank will lead to. The piggy bank itself won't share in what those
	jangling coins are jangling towards.

	There will come a day when the coins put into the piggy bank will be removed from
	the piggy bank. And that will be a particularly sad day if the coins can only be
	removed by the dissolution of the piggy bank. As in the case of Virginia's
	holiday piggy bank.

	The piggy bank lies broken like Ozymandias

	This pile of coins won't buy much of a cruise
