There is a mecca for Harry Potter fans at Watford. The
[Warner Bros studio tour](https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/home) where you
can walk in the footsteps of Harry Potter, see the scenes from the
movies, see how the movies were made, and taste something called
*butterbeer*. The studios are well-laid out for visitors, well
organised, plenty of free car parking, cafes and rest rooms, and of
course a large shop so you can take away some of that magic back home.

I'm not a Harry Potter fan but I still got something out of visiting these
studios. Firstly how much effort goes into making films of the scale of
the Harry Potter films, how many people are involved, the talents
required to create the visuals and the sounds. A useful counterpoint to
the instant gratification of our day, where eveything is a swipe away,
where everything is superficial and cheaply obtained.

Secondly how for those
working on these films how they become part of a team a second family
of those working - an experience I envy. Perhaps a reason readers
become so enmeshed in the Harry Potter books is that they identify with
Harry Potter not only in his becoming wizarding superstar royalty but
also that he finds a real true family to belong to.

Thirdly how rich the world
that J K Rowling has composited is, plenty of material for people's
imaginations to roam in. Like all authors and authoresses she has borrowed
heavily from others, cooking up her books from off the shelf ingredients.

It's a tour I would recommend.
