Title:
	Harry Potter studio tour

Text:
	There is a mecca for Harry Potter fans at Watford. The
	[https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/home Warner Bros studio tour] where you
	can walk in the footsteps of Harry Potter, see the scenes from the
	movies, see how the movies were made, and taste something called
	''butterbeer''. The studios are well-laid out for visitors, well
	organised, plenty of free car parking, cafes and rest rooms, and of
	course a large shop so you can take away some of that magic back home.

	I'm not a Harry Potter fan but I still got something out of visiting these
	studios. Firstly how much effort goes into making films of the scale of
	the Harry Potter films, how many people are involved, the talents
	required to create the visuals and the sounds. A useful counterpoint to
	the instant gratification of our day, where eveything is a swipe away,
	where everything is superficial and cheaply obtained.

	Secondly how for those
	working on these films how they become part of a team a second family
	of those working - an experience I envy. Perhaps a reason readers
	become so enmeshed in the Harry Potter books is that they identify with
	Harry Potter not only in his becoming wizarding superstar royalty but
	also that he finds a real true family to belong to.

	Thirdly how rich the world
	that J K Rowling has composited is, plenty of material for people's
	imaginations to roam in. Like all authors and authoresses she has borrowed
	heavily from others, cooking up her books from off the shelf ingredients.

	It's a tour I would recommend.
