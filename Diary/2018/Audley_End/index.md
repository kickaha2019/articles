I used up one of the days of holiday I had to use before the end of the year
and we went to [Audley End](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/audley-end-house-and-gardens/).
It was late in the season for the gardens, but there was still colour in the
parterre, nature forced into unnatural lines and arcs. A fountain fitfully
and thinly spouted.

The house is impressive, some stunning rooms. A pea-green bare room where once
they could dine and admire sunsets over the landscaped vista. This room like
others had fake doors, here added for the sake of symmetry. Another room with
red soporific silk wall hangings. Rooms full of stuffed animals, a raptor
forever clasping a rabbit in its talons. A marquetry topped table with a complex
diagram telling of all the kinds of wood used in it. A nursery the only room
photographs were allowed. A gallery of coal.

We went on the pantry tour which told of Mr Lincoln, a butler to the landed
gentry here. Round the pantry was a display of the silver, including a large
tankard with a hundred coins on it. In those days the servants were supposed
to be little more than robots, at the call of a bell all the hours of the
day, not having a life outside. Mr Lincoln on the census was declared as
single yet managed to have a wife and sons.

The staff were knowledgeable and friendly. There were plenty of cars in the
car park, but it didn't feel crowded out. Happily we avoided a school party
who were there too.
