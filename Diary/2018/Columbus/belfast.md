We took a taxi from what we were told was Stormont Wharf to see the
[Titanic Exhibition](https://titanicbelfast.com/) in Belfast. A lot of
effort has been put into this exhibition, and there is plenty of
material for school parties to gorge on. The building itself
is striking. The exhibition stressed the importance of Belfast itself
at the time that the Titanic was built and sent on her tragic way.

We also walked the decks of the Nomadic in a dry dock near the
exhibition, a tender used to ferry passengers to the Titanic. A slice
of history, as were the photographs on display. Rain unexpectedly (to us)
pelted down as we left the Nomadic and we got rather damp, retreating to
the bistro at the exhibition for some soup. We then caught a taxi back
to the ship.

It was then we discovered that the "Columbus" had not docked at the
Stormont Wharf as people on the ship had claimed. Luckily the taxi driver
didn't give up but tried another dock in which our ship was actually
berthed, but it was a more expensive taxi ride than we had planned!
