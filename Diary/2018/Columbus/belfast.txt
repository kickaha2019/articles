	We took a taxi from what we were told was Stormont Wharf to see the
 [https://titanicbelfast.com/ Titanic Exhibition] in Belfast. A lot of
 effort has been put into this exhibition, and there is plenty of
 material for school parties to gorge on. The building itself
 is striking. The exhibition stressed the importance of Belfast itself
 at the time that the Titanic was built and sent on her tragic way.

 We also walked the decks of the Nomadic in a dry dock near the
 exhibition, a tender used to ferry passengers to the Titanic. A slice
 of history, as were the photographs on display. Rain unexpectedly (to us)
 pelted down as we left the Nomadic and we got rather damp, retreating to
 the bistro at the exhibition for some soup. We then caught a taxi back
 to the ship.

 It was then we discovered that the "Columbus" had not docked at the
 Stormont Wharf as people on the ship had claimed. Luckily the taxi driver
 didn't give up but tried another dock in which our ship was actually
 berthed, but it was a more expensive taxi ride than we had planned!
