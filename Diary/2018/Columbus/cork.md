![English Market Cork](cork1.jpg)
We caught the shuttle bus from the port at Ringaskiddy
into Cork with our friends Terry and Cath, had a drink at
a coffee shop, admired the odd leaning lamp posts
advertising a show, and by serendipity discovered the
enchanting [English Market](http://www.englishmarket.ie/).
This is a traditional covered market selling food, and with a cafe
upstairs.
