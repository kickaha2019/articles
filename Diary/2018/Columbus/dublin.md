We caught the shuttle bus into Dublin and walked around a
little, seeing a statue of Molly Malone, seeing how long the
queues were for the Book of Kells in Trinity College Dublin,
checking out a gift shop or two. We did wander into the
[Natural History Museum](https://www.museum.ie/Natural-History).

I don't like big cities. They are oppressive to me, particularly
unfamiliar big cities. I feel dislocated and lost. There seemed
to be a lot of beggars but you don't have to go to Ireland to
find those down and out.
