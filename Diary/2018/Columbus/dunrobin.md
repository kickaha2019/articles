We did an excursion from Invergordon to see
[Dunrobin Castle](http://www.dunrobincastle.co.uk) which has a lot of history
in its walls. The Castle has evolved over the centuries as has its inhabitants.
The Castle has gone from being a military stronghold to being a
stately home with treasures to see. Its inhabitants have gone from wild lawless
robber barons through ruthless opportunists during the Highland clearances to
respected cultured nobility.

The Castle has a well laid out garden in which a fascinating falconry display
took place. The guy doing it was very easy to listen to, and eager to share his
knowledge. He was scathing about the BBC and its nature documentaries which he
felt propagated myths. A shock to have his massive eagle owl flying just over head!
He stressed that some owls are diurnal not nocturnal.

There is also a museum with an eerie collection of
hunting trophies as well as Pictish stones with cryptic carvings on them.
The guide said we call them Picts because they drew pictures on
themselves, I assume that was true rather than a joke.
The museum and gardens are down a steep series of steps from the Castle, time
needs to be allowed to climb back!
