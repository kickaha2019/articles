The swell meant it was very slow getting people ashore by tender
from the ship. We didn't get to St Peter Port until lunchtime!

We did some shopping before returning to the Columbus. Virginia
got some things at a chemist, but then we had to spend the
change as it wouldn't have been legal tender back home. So
we got some confectionery as gifts and Virginia patronised a
Body Shop while I window shopped at a camera place opposite.
