A long pilgrimage by coach to worship at Monet's house and garden
in Giverny. This is a very popular
[site](http://giverny.org/gardens/fcm/visitgb.htm), and the narrow
paths were packed making getting round difficult to impossible. Pilgrims had
come from all round the world.

The gardens are well tended and there is a lot to see, the
Japanese gardens over the road (accessed by an underpass sponsored
by a Japanese) are very photogenic. In the house you see shadows
left by Monet.

I did wonder why everyone had come to this temple of Art. Was it
in the hope that some greatness might rub off, like people visit
temples in the hope holiness will rub off? Or was it on the official
bucket list? Our guide explained some details of Monet's life, but
she didn't try to explain what impressionism was. You don't need the
theory to appreciate the art, but I felt despite being where Monet
painted masterpieces any appreciation going was superficial.

The shop was big, and well stocked - we got Monet place mats and
a fridge magnet and socks. I wonder what Claude Monet would have
made of his pictures on shopping bags. Perhaps he would have been
pleased.

Escaping from the scrum we had a drink and creme caramels at a nearby
cafe, kudos to them for catering for the language limited Brits.
