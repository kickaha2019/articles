	A tender ride to Tobermory but at least they could dock 2 tenders at the pier.
  We walked along the frontage, Virginia got lip balm at a very smelly bath soap shop,
  and a small bag at a Church converted into a cafe and shop.
  We had a massive hot bowl of tomato soup and coffee at
  [http://macgochans-tobermory.co.uk/ Macgochans]. Very nice there as it had free WiFi!

  Houses of different colours, difficult parking, overflowing with visitors.

  The sea was choppy, they made us wait at points because of it.
