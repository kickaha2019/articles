We had a very pleasant time with our friends Andy and Lianna on
the Isle of Skye, they run [The Roses B&B](https://www.therosesbb.co.uk/en-GB) there.
Skye seems to have a lot of B&Bs, it also has a lot of potholes in the
roads, Lianna had injured herself driving in the rain by thinking a
pothole was only a puddle because of the water on the road.

They took us to [Dunvegan Castle](https://www.dunvegancastle.com/) which is
another castle with plenty of history, and connections to Flora Macdonald
of the Skye Boat Song fame. The founders of the Macleod clan seemed to
have Viking style names to me. Dunvegan also has a decent garden with
a natural looking waterfall in it.

We dined at the [Old School Restaurant](http://www.oldschoolrestaurant.co.uk/),
which was a challenge for Andy to park at. Good place to eat at. Old school is
good school to me.

Andy and Lianna took us on a tour of some of Skye which has a lot of
windswept hills and lochs, rugged landscapes. We managed to park at the very busy
[Kilt Rock](https://www.theskyeguide.com/see-and-do-mainmenu-35/27-natural-wonders/177-kilt-rock)
where a waterfall hurls itself into the sea from a cliff.
