	We had a very pleasant time with our friends Andy and Lianna on
 the Isle of Skye, they run [https://www.therosesbb.co.uk/en-GB The Roses B&B] there.
 Skye seems to have a lot of B&Bs, it also has a lot of potholes in the
 roads, Lianna had injured herself driving in the rain by thinking a
 pothole was only a puddle because of the water on the road.

 They took us to [https://www.dunvegancastle.com/ Dunvegan Castle] which is
 another castle with plenty of history, and connections to Flora Macdonald
 of the Skye Boat Song fame. The founders of the Macleod clan seemed to
 have Viking style names to me. Dunvegan also has a decent garden with
 a natural looking waterfall in it.

 We dined at the [http://www.oldschoolrestaurant.co.uk/ Old School Restaurant],
 which was a challenge for Andy to park at. Good place to eat at. Old school is
 good school to me.
