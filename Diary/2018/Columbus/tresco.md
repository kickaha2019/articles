Local watermen ferried us in open boats from our ship at anchor to
the island of Tresco as I admired the numerous rocks around, Virginia
much preferred the lifeboats that the Columbus normally used as tenders.
Happily the weather shone upon us this day.

Tresco was beautiful, a harmony of rock and sea and vegetation. We walked
from the landing point to the
[Tresco Abbey Garden](https://www.tresco.co.uk/enjoying/abbey-garden) which is
a large sloping garden full of diversity. This was my favourite port of call
of the whole cruise. There was much to see, plants in bloom, collections from
different areas in the world, yet there was plenty of room so one didn't feel
one was fighting one's way through a crowd. There were seats to sit on,
a cafe to have an ice-cream at and resist buying fancy socks at, and a collection
of figureheads from shipwrecks around the Scilly Isles.

It was a good walk from the gardens to New Grimsby where the open boats collected
us to take us back to the Columbus. It was worth making sure we fitted onto
the first boat.
