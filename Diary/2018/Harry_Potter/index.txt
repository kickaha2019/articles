	We went to [https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/home Warner Bros studio tour]
  to walk again in the footsteps of Harry Potter. Virginia's sister Vicky
  was over from New Zealand and this was a joint family outing.
  I made a fool of myself going
  through security, I keep having to remove metallic items from my pockets!

  The entrance had changed, you have a long walk past quotes from the books
  on the hoardings. The exhibits you walk past haven't changed, but it is still
  well done and worth one visit at least. Our New Zealand visitors enjoyed it.

  The day had torrential rain - we had a nightmare journey home, crawling through
  the St Albans area then crawling up the A1.
