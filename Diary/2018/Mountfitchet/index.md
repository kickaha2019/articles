So we used up another of the days of holiday I had to use before the end of the year.
Let's go to [Mountfitchet Castle](https://mountfitchetcastle.com/), that'll be a nice
outing I thought. It was when we got there, and discovered the car park full, that
we realised half term week was not a great time to go there. The place was heaving with
children, both under parental control and under teacher control (there was a large
school party there).

I remembered the toy museum on the hill - I'm a sucker for places like that.
I didn't remember it had so much war memorabilia in it. And I certainly didn't
remember the dinosaurs guarding the entrance with water cannon. You had to
time your dash for the door to the toy museum carefully or you got soaked
with water. Glad dinosaurs are now extinct.

We wandered around the reconstruction of a Norman wooden castle site.
There is a lot of information there, it does give an impression of those
times. Not good times for the villeins and serfs and poachers. The lords
really lorded it over everyone else. The cafe was heaving so we had lunch
somewhere else, ending up at our nearest [Beefeater](https://www.beefeater.co.uk/steak-restaurant/Cambridge/Travellers-Rest.html).
