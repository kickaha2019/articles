Every year we go to see the snowdrops at [Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill). The gardeners of the
[National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/) even in winter manage to create a marvellous display of
textures and shades and colours and shapes in the gardens there. The snowdrops
were out in force when we went, the different varieties explained in signs
which we saw but didn't really read.

There are lots of days in a year. As humans we need to divide up the year in
some way to make it less intimidating. In the past they had harvest and the
equinoxes and the solstices. Now perhaps we have see the snowdrop day, and
Valentine's Day, and Bank Holidays. And Black Fridays?

Beside the snowdrops there were other visitors out in force, coachloads of
them. I began to compare them to migratory birds, and wondered how many
in December would migrate to see the [Thursford Christmas Spectacular](https://www.thursford.com/christmas-spectacular/).

We did mean to eat at [Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill) in the airy and light cafeteria,
and walked around a bit more so the time approached noon when hot food
became available. However there were so many people there, and the
likelihood of finding a table to eat at low, so we went elsewhere for
our lunch.
