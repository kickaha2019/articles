The [Thursford Christmas Spectacular](https://www.thursford.com/christmas-spectacular/) is almost a fixed
part of our year, which we observe. The show is pretty much the
same each year, I could do without the comedian and his toilet
humour. There was a foreign lass juggling stuff while lying on
her back for variety.

The shops were more crowded this year, and the marquee had pretty
much filled up when we got there just after 12pm thanks to a
detour the Satnav suggested. It is a long haul there and back,
but it is a grand size show.
