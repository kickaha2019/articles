Virginia's family enjoy a special toffee made from a secret family recipe.
Virginia's grandmother on her father's side made it, and Virginia
now makes it as a must have treat for the Keel family Christmas.
We wouldn't be admitted to the Boxing Day Christmas ritual without
having brought it down from Cambridge.

(Virginia did discover the secret behind the secret family recipe,
that it's not a secret at all. It's
actually Everton Toffee from a recipe book by Hilda Elsie Marguerite Patten.)
