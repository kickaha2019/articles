	[/Users/peter/Sites/Games/MugMissing/index.html Mug. Missing.] is a text based, CYOA (choose your own
  adventure) style game. The plot has you searching for your coffee
  mug across a range of locations and times, hence the name of the
  game! There aren't puzzles as such, the choices each player makes
  decides the order they experience the game in rather than affect
  the final outcome.

  I was struck by the observation that the order of episodes doesn't
  really matter in stories like Don Quixote, let alone TV soap operas.
  I think Lee Sheldon made this observation in a book he wrote.
  So I was tempted to do a work of interactive fiction where the
  player apparently has real choices, but all those choices do is
  drive the order they experience the episodes in.

  I don't claim this is an original idea, one of the laws I remember
  from my university days is if you think you've discovered something
  new then either someone's already discovered it or you're wrong.
  But I want to do some kind of game, and a story with multiple paths
  through it appeals on an aesthetic level to me.

  ''Mug. Missing.'' is not remotely serious. Achieving a
  polymorphic story is easier if one can abandon realism or
  sense to start with.

  ''Mug. Missing.'' is implemented in a custom DSL transcompiled to
  Tweego input files. Ruby code is used to do this transcompilation,
  it's in a

  I have uploaded the game as well to [https://itch.io/ itch.io]
