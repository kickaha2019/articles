We made up for yesterday's failures by seeing loads of museums in Dorchester today, making full use of a [Golden Saver](https://www.goldsaverpass.com) ticket. Not large museums as museums go, but with their own charm. I liked the [Teddy Bear Museum](https://www.teddybearmuseum.co.uk) most, I have a soft spot for soft toys. We then did the [Dinosaurs Museum](https://www.thedinosaurmuseum.com), which featured dinosaurs unsurprisingly.

We took in the Terracotta Warriors museum (reproductions not the originals) as well as the Tutankhamen Museum (again reproductions). A bit macabre for me the last one. As it was about lunchtime we went to an Old Tea Shoppe for a drink and sandwiches (I had Welsh rarebit which I still think should be said rabbit). We then walked from there to a [Roman Villa](https://www.dorsetforyou.gov.uk/libraries-history-culture/local-history-heritage/roman-town-house/roman-town-house.aspx) in the grounds of council offices. Only on arriving at the glass structure covering the mosaics did we discover that as close as we got to them!

In the evening we dined at the [Sun Inn](https://www.sun-inn-dorchester.co.uk/)
not that far from Charminster, enjoying its carvery. A nice wooden beamed pub, great atmosphere, just a little dim where we were sitting. My father always said that the more expensive restaurant the less brightly lit it was. The [Sun Inn](https://www.sun-inn-dorchester.co.uk/) bucked that trend.
