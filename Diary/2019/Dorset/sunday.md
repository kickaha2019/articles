Not one of our more successful days. We failed to make the morning service at [Weymouth Baptist Church](http://www.weychurch.co.uk) (forgot it was 10am, nightmare trying to park in Weymouth, bridge over harbour exit up at one point). So we sauntered round the esplanade and sat for a while in well manicured gardens. Then we failed to get to the [Beefeater](https://www.beefeater.co.uk/steak-restaurant/Dorset/Weymouth-Weymouth.html) for Sunday lunch that we had booked, the Satnav kept wanting us to use a blocked road. The same blockage stopped us getting to the [Weymouth Sea Life](https://www.visitsealife.com/weymouth/discover/) place. So we ate at Pizza Express in [Brewery Square](http://www.brewerysquare.com/) which disagreed with Virginia.

Holidays I find are stressful, particularly when driving around lost, or driving around mazes
of streets like Weymouth was, or even more particularly when driving around lost in a maze of narrow streets. The Satnavs seem to like taking you down one car wide lanes which means
you're always on edge. Cruises once you're on board are more relaxing.
