We were about to use our [National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/) membership again at [Kingston Lacy](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/kingston-lacy) but the Satnav died,
eerily exactly a year since we lost Tabitha. We felt bereft and lost, no car atlas in the car,
we were lost in the wilds. You come to rely on technology and only realise how much you rely
when it's taken away. So we went into Dorchester as we knew the way by now, parking by
Brewery Square, and found Tourist Information. The sign said closed but they still helped us.
So Waterstones sold us a car atlas, no-one wanted to sell me moccasins, and we also got
some polyfilla for holes in the home. We then visited a [Halfords](https://www.halfords.com/stores/dorchester) down Weymouth Road
and got a new Satnav. At first we couldn't get it to look up places by post code, the menus
have changed a little.

Saw Hardy's home at [Max Gate](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/max-gate) (like many other places difficult to park). In the evening
another carvery at the reliable [Sun Inn](https://www.sun-inn-dorchester.co.uk/). Thursday evening was enlivened by the bell ringers
practising at the next door Church!
