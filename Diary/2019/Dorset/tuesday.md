The Satnav led us to farmland and then gave up when we asked it to take us to see [Maiden Castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/maiden-castle/),
so we gave up and headed somewhere else. Happily en route to somewhere we saw signs for [Maiden Castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/maiden-castle/) so off we went to be Iron Age Celts for an hour. [Maiden Castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/maiden-castle/) is a hill of mounds and ridges and ancient earthworks, complete with a school party! Good exercise up and down the ridges, though the palisades and dwellings had long gone.

We then voyaged to [Athelhampton House and Gardens](https://www.athelhampton.com) where we had lunch (ample sandwiches). After lunch we toured the house, in the main hall a picture of fighting bishop with black dot on him due to bitumen cauterisation during a battle. In the upper floor a gallery of art by an artist Marevna who was connected to the house and also to schools of pointillism and cubism. The gardens were very soothing and cultured and well laid out, with topiary and fountains. A nice place to visit.

Back at Charminster we tried to find village shop but I gave up too quickly on the right path, so instead we drove the car again and found a Lidl. In the evening back to the [Sun Inn](https://www.sun-inn-dorchester.co.uk/) for nourishment in the evening, no carvery this time but fitted in a pudding (Dorset apple cake and custard for me).
