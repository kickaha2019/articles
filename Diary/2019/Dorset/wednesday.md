![Monkey World](P1390260.jpg)
We went to see [Monkey World](http://www.monkeyworld.org/), which while it kept the animals in cages they were as good cages as I've seen - cages inter-connected by wire mesh tubes so the animals could roam around. The chimpanzees etc had generous areas. I was impressed that this zoo did as well as it did. To show our approval we got a tea towel. The animals (the larger ones) all have names and you can sponsor them. Join their fan clubs.

We also did the homage to tanks of [Tank World](https://www.tankmuseum.org/home), sited on an army barracks, and then saw the [cottage](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hardys-cottage) Hardy was born in. For an evening meal we headed to [Brewery Square](http://www.brewerysquare.com/) in Dorchester again and ate in Zizzis, I had lasagne then a calzone for dessert which needed knife and fork not a spoon!
