  We went to see [http://www.monkeyworld.org/ Monkey World], which while it kept the animals in cages they were as good cages as I've seen - cages inter-connected by wire mesh tubes so the animals could roam around. The chimpanzees etc had generous areas. I was impressed that this zoo did as well as it did. To show our approval we got a tea towel. The animals (the larger ones) all have names and you can sponsor them. Join their fan clubs.

  We also did the homage to tanks of [https://www.tankmuseum.org/home Tank World], sited on an army barracks, and then saw the [https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hardys-cottage cottage] Hardy was born in. For an evening meal we headed to [http://www.brewerysquare.com/ Brewery Square] in Dorchester again and ate in Zizzis, I had lasagne then a calzone for dessert which needed knife and fork not a spoon!
