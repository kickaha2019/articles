My birthday fell on a Saturday this year, during Feast Week
in Histon. A Flower Festival is held in the
Parish Church [St Andrews Histon](http://standrewshiston.org/) during Feast Week,
and Virginia and I like to go and see the displays. It was an
uncomfortably hot day with a boring blue sky, but looking at flowers
diverted attention for a while.
