Text:
	My birthday fell on a Saturday this year, during Feast Week
  in Histon. A Flower Festival is held in the
  Parish Church [St Andrews Histon] during Feast Week,
  and Virginia and I like to go and see the displays. It was an
  uncomfortably hot day with a boring blue sky, but looking at flowers
  diverted attention for a while.
