My sister Laura and her husband Phillip took Virginia and me to
[Nevills Cafe](https://www.nevillarms.co.uk/cafe)
in Medbourne, a charming old village with a stream running straight through it.
By the traditional Church the stream even makes a ford! A lot of water had
fallen recently and a Land Rover and trailer made a bigger splash when
they rushed across the ford. There's an ancient pack horse bridge there too
if one doesn't want to get one's feet wet.

The cafe was interesting, but I don't know I want the cucumber and mint presse
again. So colourless I thought they had brought me water by mistake! But the
taste was so so pungent.

We then went to [Foxton Locks](https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/places-to-visit/foxton-locks), a picturesque marvel of canal engineering
where canal boats can ascend or descend in a staircase of ten locks manned
by volunteers. To save water there are side ponds and two sluices for each lock.
A popular spot with a pub at the bottom, and a cafe at the top which we
patronised for ice cream cones.
