We were in the same cabin E89 on the [Arcadia](https://www.pocruises.com/cruise-ships/arcadia/) as we had been before. [P&amp;O](https://www.pocruises.com/)
laid on some special touches to welcome us back. To help us get going
in the mornings when we were in port there could be enthusiastic banging
outside as deckhands sought to repaint the [Arcadia](https://www.pocruises.com/cruise-ships/arcadia/). One day we even had a
painter outside to vary the view. They wash the promenade deck of the [Arcadia](https://www.pocruises.com/cruise-ships/arcadia/)
down at 2am in the morning. One good thing about the promenade deck of the
[Arcadia](https://www.pocruises.com/cruise-ships/arcadia/) is that you can walk all the way round the ship on it (3 times for
a mile), unless
sections are cordoned off for painting as they often were.

We had good table companions where we normally ate in the Meridian
Restaurant, Angela and Colin and Jane and Chris, table 52 first sitting.
Chris had neat glasses which held together using magnets but could
split in half. Very neat. We bumped into our fellow diners around the ship,
and when ashore which was pleasant.
6 is a good number to have on such a table for conversation. Eating-wise on board I
particularly enjoyed our trip to the Ocean Grill, that was a great
experience, the food was high-class. A little luxury, you do pay a supplement to
eat in the Ocean Grill or Sindhu, but it's very reasonable.
Didn't enjoy the Sindhu so much this time.
On a cruise I overindulge on syrup with my porridge in the mornings,
fried bread then too, and two starters and perhaps cheese and biscuits
with the evening meals. When it's crowded the Belvedere buffet on an
upper deck is hard to find anywhere to sit and eat, eating in the
Meridian you have more chance of talking to people. One breakfast we
spoke to people who had been on the Columbus last year on a round
Britain cruise, but one before the [cruise](2018/Columbus) we did. The
Columbus had problems and they didn't get to 3 ports of call! And only
&pound;50 compensation per cabin.

The [Arcadia](https://www.pocruises.com/cruise-ships/arcadia/) has a decent theatre so you don't need to be at the front
to see something. The Headliners company of singers and dancers were as
impressive as ever, for the energy and smiles and ability they put into the shows.
We saw four shows by them, including a mix of vaudeville magic and song and dance
called "Astonishing". Something different, not quite astonishing for me.
The [Arcadia](https://www.pocruises.com/cruise-ships/arcadia/) has a well equipped theatre with turntables etc.
We also went to some talks by a historian who argued that the spice trade
was responsible for the discovery of America, he may well have been right
but I tend to distrust simple answers nowadays. He was entertaining and
thoughtful to listen to.

For the first time we didn't need to take our lifejackets to the muster drill,
not that I'm complaining but it felt odd. We turned up at the appointed time
but if you want to be able to sit getting there half an hour earlier is
advised. For the theatre too getting there half an hour is advised.
Our cases hadn't arrived by the time we went to the muster drill
but Paulito our steward had put them inside our cabin on our return. Always a
relief to see the cases again. The staff on board ships like the [Arcadia](https://www.pocruises.com/cruise-ships/arcadia/)
work very hard, even though P&O say they've done away with tipping we still
tipped.

One Sunday fell on a seaday so we did have a service then. Slightly
mechanical and perfunctory, I've heard the story "The Dash" before and it's
not Christian in thought really. It was a prayer book service which some hate
as thoughtless routine, but non-prayer book services can be thoughtless
routines too.

Only once at Isafjordur in Iceland did we need a tender to go ashore - a novelty to me was the Jaws mat
which showed how much you had to be able to step across to get into
the tender safely. Getting around was difficult for the passengers who
relied on mobility scooters, one unhappy faced bald guy made me think of Davros.
There were people who were seriously obese onboard. There were places
to sit and read, I did read quite a few books on this cruise. Cruises
are when I do most of my reading these days.

For the last formal night I wore my Winnie-the-Pooh tie the last night and one
kind gent praised it as a seriously cool tie. That made my day! Formal nights
on cruise ships are the only times I wear ties now.
