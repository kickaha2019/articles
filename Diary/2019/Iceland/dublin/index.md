We did an excursion in Dublin which took us round some of Dublin including a stop
to snap St Patrick's Cathedral, together with narration about various statues.
There's history here, the Irish are very conscious of their history.
We were then dropped off at the
[Arlington Hotel](https://www.arlington.ie/celtic-nights.html) in
Dublin for a delightful cut-down version of the Celtic Nights show held there.
We had originally booked an excursion to see the Riverdance show
at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, but that got cancelled so we booked
this excursion instead.

The dancing and singing being done in a pub-like setting made
the show more immediate, closer, cosier. There was more rapport between
the audience and performers than there could be at a larger scale show
in a proper theatre. The performers were good, knew their stuff, the
Irish dancers quick and nimble. I particularly enjoyed it when they
danced without a musical accompaniment, their skilled feet playing a complex melody
on the floor.
