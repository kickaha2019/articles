  Iceland is an island sitting on the rift between the American and Eurasian
  tectonic plates. It grows as those plates move apart, it is active volcanically,
  much of the terrain is lava fields more or less colonised by nature with first
  lichen then small plant life. The crust in Iceland is only 2km thick which means
  hot stuff easily bubbles to the surface.

  Our first excursion was from Akureyri which took us first to
  Hverir or N&aacute;mafjall which is near Lake Myvatn. An impressive
  area of sulphurous fumes escaping from the ground. Our Norwegian
  guide told the Icelandic for river sounds like "ow", and that lupins
  were introduced to stop erosion but are now an infestation. This excursion also took us to
  [https://www.icelandtravel.is/attractions/dimmuborgir/ Dimmuborgir]
  where with imagination you can see petrified trolls in the curlicued lava mounds and pillars.
  Lunch on this excursion was diabolical and I had to buy something edible at a
  nearby shop.

  The highlight of the Akureyri excursion was
  [https://www.northiceland.is/en/other/place/godafoss-waterfall Godafoss], literally
  God Waterfall where the guy who made Christianity official in 1000AD threw his
  statuettes of Odin and Thor etc afterwards. Spectacular sight, dicey walking to see
  the falls from lower down.

  On the first day in Reykjavik we wandered in to see Hallgrim's Church, which
  looked like a spaceship had landed. Sadly we couldn't go in as it was a Sunday
  and there were services. We dipped into some souvenir shops to find stuff
  to take back to prove we had been to Iceland, I almost got a tin
  of mountain air as a present.

  The second day we did the "Ring of Fire" excursion.
  Icelanders have harnessed geothermal energy thanks to the thinness of the
  crust. They generate
  electricity but also pipe hot water into the cities like Reykjavik. We first saw a
  power station at [https://www.geothermalexhibition.com/ Hellisheidi] from where
  hot water flows in pipes on the surface which go up and down and twist and turn
  rather oddly. Next was an early lunch at a geothermal kitchen
  [http://www.kjotogkunst.is/ Kj&ouml;t &amp; K&uacute;nst] where food is cooked
  apparently geothermally. This part of the excursion was badly done - people queued
  to collect the food but there wasn't enough time for those who were last to eat
  before the coach left. This was a common feature of excursions, not enough time at
  the different stops.

  Also in [https://www.hveragerdi.is/English/ Hverager&eth;i] is a geothermal
  park where you can cook food in hot pools. Our lovely Icelandress guide said we would be
  walking in a park with creatures - there are steaming craters in the park but
  it's more of a backyard scale. Less impressive on the bubble toil and trouble front
  than Hverir.

  The highlight of the Reykjavik excursion was [https://www.thingvellir.is/en/ Thingvellir] where you can walk between
  the American and Eurasian plates. The plates are moving apart so I wasn't
  afraid of being crushed. A good view over the lake here. Thingvellir is
  &thorn;hingvellir in Icelandic using one of the characters (thorn) which English lost
  centuries ago.

  We had a panoramic drive back where the coach struggled up
  steep hills, I thought we were all going to have to get out and push. We
  did see a lot of holiday homes in the volcanic terrain, Icelanders like
  to spend the winter months reading and writing books apparently.
  Our guide sang a lullaby well to us when we came towards the
  end of the excursion. She also told us about Icelandic names, Icelanders
  don't have surnames like we do, instead they get their father's first name
  followed by son or daughter added to distinguish different people. Family
  history must be interesting for Icelanders.
