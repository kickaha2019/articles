Our first port of call was Olden, a very pretty village in a pretty fjord setting.
We wandered ashore rather than take an excursion, we had been to Olden
before where we did a tour to a glacier which resulted in Virginia
spraining her ankle. We went as far as a small Church which had antlers on the ends of
the pews. Virginia looked at socks in the souvenir shops but resisted
temptation. The soft toy Beatrice we brought with us was photographed
in various spots.

The second port of call was &Aring;ndalsnes, a bigger but less pretty place.
We hadn't been there before. We patronised
a chemist for Virginia to get nail varnish remover, and a supermarket where
we got water and notebooks to write things in. Happily English is fairly
well understood, and credit cards usable rather than having to have Euros.

The most interesting thing we
saw in &Aring;ndalsnes was a
[railway carriage](https://visitromsdal.com/en/andalsnes-togkapell-2-en/) converted into a chapel close to where
we had docked. Consecrated by Bishop Odd Bondevik in 2003 - doubtless some
English names look odd to the Norwegians.
