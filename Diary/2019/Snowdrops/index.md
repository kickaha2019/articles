Seeing snowdrops time again at [Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill)! A wonderfully fine day for
doing so! The snowdrops were out! The cream on the mixture of textures and
shapes and hues on display. What problem could there be? They even had
the underthrow wheel at the mill working!

Well it was half-term, a wonderfully sunny day, and most of Cambridgeshire
had turned up. We barely found space in the overflow car park to the overflow
car park. [National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/)'s website had warned us. So it was our own fault.
My sister had come down to Cambridge which was why we went on this Friday.
