  Ephesus with soft toy
  
Text:
	Our soft toys have been with us to numerous places, sometimes in
  person but more often in spirit. Their view of the world and the places
  in the world are different to ours, and deserve to be heard. So I
  have interviewed them, and gathered together their comments into a
  few web pages using [http://twinery.org/ Twine] to organise them.
  
  Go to [/Users/peter/Sites/Games/ToyTrips/index.html Toy trips] to read what they have to say!

  I plan to do a version of these pages
  as a virtual treasure hunt for
  Virginia to find where I've hidden her presents and cards.
