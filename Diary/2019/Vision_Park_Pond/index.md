In front of the Sovereign House offices on
[Vision Park](https://www.visionparkcambridge.com/) in
Histon that I work in (as of 2019) there
is a gentle pond. It has a fountain that is sometimes spurting forth,
water lilies that in their season squat on the surface, and ducks
that keep on trying to rear ducklings but keep losing them to
herons and other predators. Watching over the pond
there is a coffee and sandwich
bar [d:licious](http://www.d-licious.org/) which I patronise once a week.

In early 2019 they (whoever they are in this case) decided that this
pond needed a makeover. This was a radical makeover which involved removing
the fish and terrapins, digging the pond right out, laying new liners,
reseeding the surrounding green. As something to put on my website
here is a photographic record of the process.
