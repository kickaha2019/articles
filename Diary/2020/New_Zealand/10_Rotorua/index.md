I checked into the posh [Regent of Rotorua](https://regentrotorua.co.nz/) hotel,
and showered after my long black
disaster at [The Shire's Rest](https://www.hobbitontours.com/en/the-shires-rest/).
The hotel even rang my room to see if I was happy!

Google Maps got me to [Te Puia](https://tepuia.com/) where a Maori guide explained their culture and the
importance of their body tattoo-ing. We were shown a well where traditional crafts
are passed on, and taken round some of the volcanic attractions at [Te Puia](https://tepuia.com/). The guide
explained the ruined hotel which had been built in the wrong place and had
a sinkhole open under it. We also
saw a kiwi in a kiwi house before returning to the main buildings.
We watched as they lifted the food for the hangi meal we were going to have from the oven pits.
There was some Maori dancing and singing, I didn't go up on stage as some brave people did.
I dined on table 22 with 5 Americans which was great before returning to the
hotel. There was no space in the Regent's car park so parked on street
but had to move car before 9am.

Had a Spanish omelette for breakfast (veg including brocolli) then drove to
[Waiotapu](https://www.waiotapu.co.nz/).
First stop was the Lady Knox geyser where a vast crowd had gathered to see them
tip soap down the funnel to produce a spume. At first it just bubbled soapily then
spurted forth high. I didn't know until then that this is a common practice so
geysers keep to a tourist timetable. Walked round some of [Waiotapu](https://www.waiotapu.co.nz/)'s volcanic area:
frothing mud pools, collapsed craters still steaming away, a champagne pool with
bubbles which had a green daughter pool off it. Rather popular but it was summer holidays
here.

As I was driving around saw signs asking people to report wallabies, apparently
wallabies have joined possums as pests here. On way to airport tried to refuel at BP
garage but they wanted you to prepay first for a set number of gallons so that didn't work.
Got luggage tag at kiosks but too soon to drop bag off so had a chicken and
cheese toastie and lemon ginger tea to pass the time.

The plane itself was a small turbo-prop. Shaky on flight as it was a smaller plane and I
trembled more from the turbulence than I did on the larger jets.
