Finding the [Robot Restaurant](https://shinjuku-robot.com/sp/)
in Shinjuku was a little difficult despite it only being
3 minutes from my hotel. [Hotel Gracery](https://shinjuku.gracery.com/)
was in a seamier area of Tokyo, and there were
dubious people around like an African who kept pestering me as I tried to find
the right place. I almost gave up, and if I had done I would have missed something rich
and strange.

Despite its name the [Robot Restaurant](https://shinjuku-robot.com/sp/) is really a weird show, a cross between
pantomime and Japanese manga and idol groups. Intended originally for Japanese businessmen
but the audience when I went were all foreign tourists. On entering you go to a waiting
area upstairs with a warmup act which is strange enough. Then you descend deep to the basement
where the show is performed between two banks of seats. The people in the front row
have the best view but have to keep clear of the performance antics. You can buy food and
merchandise, a European girl was selling drinks in lit up light bulbs. 

The show is in
three sections, the first has two drum teams battling it out, the second has
fantastic animals battling robotic armies, and the last was clever with lights
but I'm not sure what was going on. There is a finale where we got lights to wave as
giant fish had their day to silly songs. I recognised one piece of music as by
Perfume.

Perhaps a little worn and tacky, but totally wonderful and one of a kind.
