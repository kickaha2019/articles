  Finding the [Robot Restaurant]
  in Shinjuku was a little difficult despite it only being
  3 minutes from my hotel. [Hotel Gracery]
  was in a seamier area of Tokyo, and there were
  dubious people around like an African who kept pestering me as I tried to find
  the right place. I almost gave up, and if I had done I would have missed something rich
  and strange.
  
  Despite its name the [Robot Restaurant] is really a weird show, a cross between
  pantomime and Japanese manga and idol groups. Intended originally for Japanese businessmen
  but the audience when I went were all foreign tourists. On entering you go to a waiting
  area upstairs with a warmup act which is strange enough. Then you descend deep to the basement
  where the show is performed between two banks of seats. The people in the front row
  have the best view but have to keep clear of the performance antics. You can buy food and
  merchandise, a European girl was selling drinks in lit up light bulbs. The show is in
  three sections, the first has two drum teams battling it out, the second has
  fantastic animals battling robotic armies, and the last was clever with lights
  but I'm not sure what was going on. There is a finale where we got lights to wave as
  giant fish had their day to silly songs. I recognised one piece of music as by
  Perfume.
  
  Perhaps a little worn and tacky, but totally wonderful and one of a kind.
