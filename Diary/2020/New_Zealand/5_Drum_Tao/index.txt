  After the Tempura lunch I had too much time to kill before seeing the
  [http://www.drum-tao.com/main/english Drum Tao]
  [https://mangekyo-tokyo.com/en/ Mangekyo] show at the
  [https://www.alternative-theatre.jp/en/about/ Alternative Theatre].
  My feet were complaining too. My planning
  could have been better. I wasted a minute or minute seeing a Godzilla statue
  in the Yurakucho area, I also had a hot chocolate at a coffee shop to be able to
  sit down, and waste a minute or two. I patronised the facilities in the coffee shop
  but one of the functions in the smart toilet decided to fire up at the wrong moment.
  The restroom door got sprinkled.
  
  There weren't enough in the audience for what was a a great show with
  performers giving it 110%. It was Japanese drumming (traditional flute and plucked
  instruments also used) but with modern theatrics and staging and athleticism.
  Mainly male performers but also three women laying into a range of drums. During the
  show I made use of a power-pack to recharge my phone, worth taking it on this trip.
  
  We were allowed to take pictures during an encore which was kind. To show my
  appreciation of such a bravura event I purchased a DVD souvenir. The show was powerful
  sorry they didn't have more people to see it.

  On way back from Yurakucho I sat but no-one was willing to sit next to me -
  until a girl did at the last but one station. Trains very crowded all the time.
