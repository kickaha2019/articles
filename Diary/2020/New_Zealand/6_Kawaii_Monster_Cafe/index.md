![Entrance to Kawaii Monster Cafe](IMG_0806.jpg)
It was hard finding the right entrance to Shinjuku Station (Shinjuku Station
is like a multiple train station wreck) but then found my way to the
[Kawaii Monster Cafe](http://kawaiimonster.jp/) in time thanks to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).

I could hear the sound inside from miles away, it was difficult talking to the
waitresses inside. A very outre place, the decor is Alice in Wonderland with a
twisted side to it. It may have been a mistake to book through [Voyagin](https://www.govoyagin.com/), I ended
up food-wise with a combo for 2 people and too much meat! I also stupidly
tried a dessert claiming to be poison cake which was a waste of money. But the food
is not the reason one comes here.

There's a number of areas (including the toilets) each with their own distinctive
absurd almost nightmare style. When I went I was able to photograph everywhere,
the place wasn't packed. There were locals here as well as foreign tourists like me,
some seemed to be female otakus who chatted to the 'performers' for want of a better word.

Ah yes the floor show which was at the giant psychedelic mushroom.
More posing and wriggling than anything else by the oddly clad 'performers'.
But another unique experience added to the list.
