I had a second sleepless night at [Hotel Gracery](https://shinjuku.gracery.com/) so decided I couldn't risk any more
tourism. A big shame as I was looking forward to seeing
[teamLab Borderless](https://borderless.teamlab.art/), and also
this was a rare clear day ideal for going up the
[Tokyo Skytree](http://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/). I also missed out
on seeing the [Giant Ghibli Clock](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-giant-ghibli-clock-tokyo-japan). Sigh.

So instead I checked out then caught a taxi to Shinjuku Station's West Exit, and
caught the limousine bus to [Narita Airport](https://www.narita-airport.jp/en)
from there. I sat on the wrong side of the
coach, the sun was strong. I was at [Narita Airport](https://www.narita-airport.jp/en) miles
too early to even check in, and drop off my main case. Had some more tempura at
First Class Rice which was well presented. Bought some Japanese sweets which made it through
New Zealand biosecurity. Converted my remaining yen to NZ dollars.

Boarding for NZ94 at Gate 42 was delayed half an hour already due to lateness of incoming
flight, I did manage to doze a little. On the flight we had white blankets which
made the plane look like a hospital waiting room. [Air New Zealand](https://www.airnewzealand.co.uk/) kindly had the
Japanese films sub-titled, I watched [Fable](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8676426/)
and [The Confidence Man JP](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9552258/) to pass the time.
In the toilet I pressed the wrong button to flush and instead had to explain to a
stewardess there was no problem! I asked for water and they offered snacks as well very welcome.

A big reason for going to New Zealand was to see Virginia's sister Vicky who lives in
Auckland. Vicky and her husband Bruce looked after me very well, ferrying me to and from the airport
as needed. Bruce took me to [LynnMall](https://www.kiwiproperty.com/lynnmall/en/)
where I got a E-Sim from [Spark](https://www.spark.co.nz) to use which even
gave a temporary New Zealand number! We went to the
[Arataki Visitor Centre](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/environment/educationsustainability/Pages/lte-details.aspx?itemID=9)
which has great
views over the woodland down to the sea. It has a number of trails but some were shut due
to Kauri dieback. We also went to Karekare beach
(beaches were popular as January is summer holidays
down under) where the black sand was too hot for bare feet in places. The following
weekend we went with old friends of theirs to Murrays Bay Beach where we had fush and chups.
(NZ pronunciation of fish and chips).
There was a small pier out into the bay from which kids jumped into the receding water,
as time went on the beach was depopulated in favour of dog walkers and wind surfers.
Noisy at times thanks to people armed with massive boom boxes.
Some of us walked along a cliff path with a good view, I admired some of the expensive houses
that could be seen. We saw an eel in a stream at the beach.

I went to Church with them on the Sundays, celebrating communion each time.
In the morning they go to [Blockhouse Bay Community Church](https://www.bbcc.org.nz),
a well established
church. After the morning service they tend to go to the Dundale Cafe and Eatery where
I discovered that black coffees are long blacks in New Zealand, and come with a small jug of
hot water. Had a lemon citrus muffin which was very nice. In the evening they go to
the [126 Church](http://www.onetwosix.nz/) in Point Chevalier which is more experimental and interactive. An
interesting range of people attend for the bring and share meal then service.
