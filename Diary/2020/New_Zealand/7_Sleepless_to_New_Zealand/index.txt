  I had a second sleepless night at [Hotel Gracery] so decided I couldn't risk any more
  tourism. A big shame as I was looking forward to seeing
  [teamLab Borderless], and also
  this was a rare clear day ideal for going up the
  [Tokyo Skytree]. I also missed out
  on seeing the [Giant Ghibli Clock]. Sigh.
  
  So instead I checked out then caught a taxi to Shinjuku Station's West Exit, and
  caught the limousine bus to [Narita Airport]
  from there. I sat on the wrong side of the
  coach, the sun was strong. I was at [Narita Airport] miles
  too early to even check in, and drop off my main case. Had some more tempura at
  First Class Rice which was well presented. Bought some Japanese sweets which made it through
  New Zealand biosecurity. Converted my remaining yen to NZ dollars.
  
  Boarding for NZ94 at Gate 42 was delayed half an hour already due to lateness of incoming
  flight, I did manage to doze a little. On the flight we had white blankets which
  made the plane look like a hospital waiting room. [Air New Zealand] kindly had the
  Japanese films sub-titled, I watched [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8676426/ Fable]
  and [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9552258/ The Confidence Man JP] to pass the time.
  In the toilet I pressed the wrong button to flush and instead had to explain to a
  stewardess there was no problem! I asked for water and they offered snacks as well very welcome.

  A big reason for going to New Zealand was to see Virginia's sister Vicky who lives in
  Auckland. Vicky and her husband Bruce looked after me very well, ferrying me to and from the airport
  as needed. Bruce took me to [https://www.kiwiproperty.com/lynnmall/en/ LynnMall]
  where I got a E-Sim from [https://www.spark.co.nz Spark] to use which even
  gave a temporary New Zealand number! We went to the
 [https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/environment/educationsustainability/Pages/lte-details.aspx?itemID=9 Arataki Visitor Centre]
  which has great
  views over the woodland down to the sea. It has a number of trails but some were shut due
  to Kauri dieback. We also went to Karekare beach
  (beaches were popular as January is summer holidays
  down under) where the black sand was too hot for bare feet in places. The following
  weekend we went with old friends of theirs to Murrays Bay Beach where we had fush and chups.
  (NZ pronunciation of fish and chips).
  There was a small pier out into the bay from which kids jumped into the receding water,
  as time went on the beach was depopulated in favour of dog walkers and wind surfers.
  Noisy at times thanks to people armed with massive boom boxes.
  Some of us walked along a cliff path with a good view, I admired some of the expensive houses
  that could be seen. We saw an eel in a stream at the beach.
  
  I went to Church with them on the Sundays, celebrating communion each time.
  In the morning they go to [https://www.bbcc.org.nz Blockhouse Bay Community Church],
  a well established
  church. After the morning service they tend to go to the Dundale Cafe and Eatery where
  I discovered that black coffees are long blacks in New Zealand, and come with a small jug of
  hot water. Had a lemon citrus muffin which was very nice. In the evening they go to
  the [http://www.onetwosix.nz/ 126 Church] in Point Chevalier which is more experimental and interactive. An
  interesting range of people attend for the bring and share meal then service.
