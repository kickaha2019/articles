	Japan, New Zealand, Singapore

Text:
  Every three years of late I've accomplished a solo trip to exotic places. In 2016 I saw
  South Korea. In 2013 I journeyed to Japan. In 2010 it was New Zealand. So I decided to
  go somewhere in 2019 (or January 2020 close as it turned out.) But where?
  
  Virginia has a sister in Auckland and I've been to New Zealand twice already, but had
  been planning to go in 2012 taking in a solar eclipse visible in Cairns in Australia.
  That got derailed by troubles at work where we all had effectively to reapply for our
  jobs as part of a downsizing initiative. Another motivation for going to New Zealand
  was to go to see [Weta Workshop],
  cinema at its best is magic to me and I wish I could have worked in film making!
  
  Where to break the long haul to New Zealand though? Having passed 60 I now longer have
  the stamina to be travelling for 36 hours without a rest as I have done. I wanted
  to go back to Tokyo if only to finally see the [Nihon Ki-in]
  (Go is another of my major interests). I did try to visit the Nihon Ki-in when I was
  in Tokyo before but couldn't find my way there from
  [https://www.tokyometro.jp/lang_en/station/ichigaya/index.html Ichigaya Station].
  Worries about navigating in strange places was one reason I got an [iPhone] so
  I could use [Google Maps].
  
  It would be possible for me to book flights and hotels all myself but going
  through a travel agent gives me a comfort factor, that less is likely to go wrong.
  I needed a travel agent who would do customised itineraries and contacted
  [Audley Travel]. I had come across them when googling
  for previous trips, and also I knew someone at work used them. I was impressed
  by them, a professional outfit. As a customer you get a personalised website, and
  also a downloadable app for your trip. They warned me about the need to get
  a [https://nzeta.immigration.govt.nz NZeTa] when New Zealand introduced them.
  My initial stupid idea (the distances are too far) of driving round a loop in the
  North Island of New Zealand from Auckland to Wellington and back was exploded.
  But I didn't make the best use of [Audley Travel].
  
  At the time I contacted [Audley Travel] I hadn't firmed up on where I wanted to
  go, particularly in Tokyo. A travel agent can only give each customer a certain
  amount of attention, and the clock starts ticking as soon as you contact them.
  I was cherry picking where I wanted to go (by surfing sites like
  [https://www.atlasobscura.com/ Atlas Obscura]) rather than relying on a
  planned package. I hadn't tried when I suggested places I wanted to see
  put them into [Google Maps] to see how far apart
  they were - for this reason I was going to see [https://en.puroland.jp/ Sanrio Puroland] until
  that got fortuitously cancelled.
  
  I do enjoy the planning of my trips, the research behind places to see, perhaps as
  much as the trips themselves! For planning read re-planning as I kept shifting
  the itinerary around for Tokyo - the [Nihon Ki-in] I was going to visit on
  Thursday but the Wednesday was better which meant having to rebook
  going to see [teamLab Borderless] and paying twice. I like booking early but perhaps I shouldn't.
  I limited the itinerary in places arguing
  I needed more rest time - by chance I discovered that the tea house in
  [https://www.tokyo-park.or.jp/teien/en/hama-rikyu/ Hamarikyu Gardens] would be
  closed in January. I spent quite a bit of thought trying to arrange timings to
  see the [Giant Ghibli Clock] in action. It was only when I was printing out documents that
  I discovered the travel insurance I had didn't cover Japan and Singapore!
  
  This trip I relied on using credit cards as much as taking foreign currency with me.
  That worked pretty well.
  My banks claimed I didn't need to tell them I was travelling. And that proved to be
  the case!
