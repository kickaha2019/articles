We went and got a Norwegian Christmas tree from the
[Oakington Garden Centre](https://www.oakingtongardencentre.co.uk/)
on Tuesday the 1st of December. Didn't realise how prickly a
customer this tree was until we we putting it up in our lounge.
Once again I admired the simple and effective technology used
to wrap the Christmas tree in a mesh for transport. We've been
having natural trees for a while because of concerns of cats
licking and eating artifical trees (as pretty as I find fibre optic trees
and how reusable they are).

The poor tree was out in the cold garage (and it snowed on the Friday)
until Sunday when we brought it into the house, and installed it
at the lounge front window. Putting ornaments onto it was a little
tricky - one could hardly wear gloves yet the prickly foliage made its
presence felt.

We also decorated the lounge (red wool up to hang the cards on, tinsel
draped over the grandmother clock which hasn't worked for a while and
bookcases and other places). Also wove gold beading down the staircase
bannister rail - my mother didn't appreciate this when she was here one
Christmas.
