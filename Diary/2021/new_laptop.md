I failed to resist temptation and ordered a new
[Macbook](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro-13/) from
[Apple](https://www.apple.com/) shortly after Apple started
using their own chips (Apple Silicon) rather than Intel chips.
It took a few weeks to arrive, and has been an interesting
experience. I like the fingerprint ID which works very well,
the laptop performs well, but the Wi-Fi connection has been
troublesome. The laptop kept disconnecting from the Wi-Fi as
I was trying to download games from Steam.

The laptop was tending to connect on the 2.4GHz band from our
BT router rather than the more performant 5GHz band (5GHz however
has a shorter range and the antenna in the laptop may work less
well than other devices we have). Our router was set to use Channel 1
on 2.4GHz which was congested (improved by resetting that to Channel
11). There's a number of factors at play here, the number of devices
we have which has just increased, what our neighbours are doing,
how busy the network is. I did consider adding more access points
but for simplicity for the moment I'll try using Ethernet from the
router when there's big downloads involved.

I have learnt something from all this if only how to check
what Wi-Fi band a Mac system is on, and what the transfer rate is,
and what the router can tell you.
