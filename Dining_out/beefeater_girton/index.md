We go to the [Beefeater](https://www.beefeater.co.uk/steak-restaurant/Cambridge/Travellers-Rest.html)
in Girton so much the staff know us, and we know them.  It's nice
to be known, to feel one's among friends to some extent.
We keep disappointing the waiters and waitresses by
seldom ordering desserts.

You know what you're getting with the food there, especially
if you've been there as often as we've been there.  I quite
often go for the Chili Con Carne even if it's unromantic to
see the Chef squeezing the meat out of a bag.  Standard fare
at reasonable prices if you go before 6.30pm.

I like the building the Traveller's Rest (the Beefeater in
Girton) is in.  Sometimes we sit downstairs in a nice secluded
alcove.  Sometimes we site overlooking the kitchen and
wonder if it's our dishes waiting to be collected off the
metal shelves.  Sometimes we sit in the conservatory
and admire the fuchsias.

Beefeater's reward card looks like someone took a bite out of it.
