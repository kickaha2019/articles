	We go to the [https://www.beefeater.co.uk/steak-restaurant/Cambridge/Travellers-Rest.html Beefeater]
	in Girton so much the staff know us, and we know them.  It's nice 
	to be known, to feel one's among friends to some extent.
	We keep disappointing the waiters and waitresses by 
	seldom ordering desserts.

	You know what you're getting with the food there, especially
	if you've been there as often as we've been there.  I quite
	often go for the Chili Con Carne even if it's unromantic to
	see the Chef squeezing the meat out of a bag.  Standard fare
	at reasonable prices if you go before 6.30pm.

	I like the building the Traveller's Rest (the Beefeater in
	Girton) is in.  Sometimes we sit downstairs in a nice secluded 
	alcove.  Sometimes we site overlooking the kitchen and
	wonder if it's our dishes waiting to be collected off the
	metal shelves.  Sometimes we sit in the conservatory
	and admire the fuchsias.

	Beefeater's reward card looks like someone took a bite out of it.
