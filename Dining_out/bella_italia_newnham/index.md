#title Bella Italia in Newnham
#markdown
We haven't been for a while but we did go regularly to the
[Bella Italia](https://www.bellaitalia.co.uk/) in Newnham.  This
is in what used to be a water-mill and still has the
millwheel visible in a glass cabinet inside the
restaurant.  There's another glass tile in the
floor through which you can see the mill race underneath!

A chain of restaurants with pasta dishes on the menu.
Spaghetti bolognaise is one of my favourite dishes.  At
a Bella Italia I quite often have San Pellegrino
Limonata to drink.  Lemon flavours act on me like catnip
does to cats.

Nice ambience and an interesting setting. In 2016 this
restaurant was moved to Bridge Street in Cambridge.
