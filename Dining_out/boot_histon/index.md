[The Boot](https://boothiston.com/) is one of the pubs in Histon
which has been nicely converted into a brasserie. There is a
reasonably priced lunchtime menu during the week which changes each
month, we haven't tried going any other time yet. The interior is
harmonious, new with glass walls yet old with clean wooden beams.

The food and service are good, I had to have a souffle off the
a la carte menu one time and it was great. The portions are not
plate filling, but not artistically small either.
