Title:
	The Boot, Histon

Text:
	[https://boothiston.com/ The Boot] is one of the pubs in Histon
  which has been nicely converted into a brasserie. There is a
  reasonably priced lunchtime menu during the week which changes each
  month, we haven't tried going any other time yet. The interior is
  harmonious, new with glass walls yet old with clean wooden beams.

  The food and service are good, I had to have a souffle off the
  a la carte menu one time and it was great. The portions are not
  plate filling, but not artistically small either.
