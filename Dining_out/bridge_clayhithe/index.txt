	You can book at 
	[https://www.chefandbrewer.com/pubs/cambridgeshire/bridge/ The Bridge] now, before you just turned up and hoped.
	Virginia and I eat early so we beat the rush.
	
	Another building with character which I like, I want to
	believe the wooden beams are genuine and indeed they may
	be.  There's an open fire, and soft armchairs for those
	waiting.  The staff are pleasant and friendly.

	The menu includes pheasant and partridge, and a bubble
	and squeak starter.  So not run of the mill, but not
	haute cuisine either.  They now come to your table
	to take your order, before you had to go to the bar.
