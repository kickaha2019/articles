[Chiquito](https://www.chiquito.co.uk) is a TexMex restaurant chain
which had a place at Cambridge Leisure Centre, where we often see films
on Saturday mornings. It's not crowded or noisy like other restaurants
there, we've even managed to walk in and get a table at 6pm which was
a relief on a Saturday evening.

There was a good variety of meals on the menu, I didn't tried all the ones
I wanted to try. The chimichangas and burritos and quesadillas were
tasty, and presented appealingly. The staff were friendly, and indeed
recognise us even after a few visits. We normally sat in a 'booth' which
gives a little more privacy.

Oh and they did churros - a dessert I fell in love in when I went to
the [Cantina](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_GB/dining/epcot/cantina-de-san-angel/)
at the Mexican pavilion
in the World Showcase at [EPCOT](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_GB/destinations/epcot/).

Sadly Chiquitos at the Leisure Centre closed down in 2019.
