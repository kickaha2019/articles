	[https://www.chiquito.co.uk Chiquito] is a TexMex restaurant chain
	with a place at Cambridge Leisure Centre, where we often see films
	on Saturday mornings. It's not crowded or noisy like other restaurants
	there, we've even managed to walk in and get a table at 6pm which was
	a relief on a Saturday evening.

	There's a good variety of meals on the menu, I haven't tried all the ones
	I want to try yet. The chimichangas and burritos and quesadillas are
	tasty, and presented appealingly. The staff are friendly, and already
	recognise us even after a few visits. We normally sit in a 'booth' which
	gives a little more privacy.

	Oh and they do churros - a dessert I feel in love in when I went to
	the [https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_GB/dining/epcot/cantina-de-san-angel/ Cantina]
	at the Mexican pavilion
	in the World Showcase at [https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_GB/destinations/epcot/ EPCOT].
