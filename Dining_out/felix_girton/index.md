We didn't go to the
[Hotel Felix](https://www.hotelfelix.co.uk/)
for quite a while, assuming it was priced out of
our bracket.  It has an upmarket ambience, but Sunday
lunch isn't super expensive.

The artwork round the dining area sets the mood.
Modern, stylish.  The service is good and mannered and
genteel.  The food is well prepared, and one feels
well take care of.

We tend to go to the [Hotel Felix](https://www.hotelfelix.co.uk/) for our cats'
birthdays.  It seems appropriate!  Sadly we don't take
our cats which probably seems rather mean.
