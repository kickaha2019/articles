	We didn't go to the 
	[Hotel Felix]
	for quite a while, assuming it was priced out of
	our bracket.  It has an upmarket ambience, but Sunday
	lunch isn't super expensive.

	The artwork round the dining area sets the mood.  
	Modern, stylish.  The service is good and mannered and
	genteel.  The food is well prepared, and one feels
	well take care of.  

	We tend to go to the [Hotel Felix] for our cats'
	birthdays.  It seems appropriate!  Sadly we don't take
	our cats which probably seems rather mean.
