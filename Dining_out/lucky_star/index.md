@title		Lucky Star Chinese Buffet
@markdown
We used to go to the
*Lucky Star* quite a
lot, after seeing a film at what was
*Cineworld* next door.
For Virginia and I that makes a good start to the weekend,
seeing a film then eating.

*Lucky Star* was an all you can eat Chinese buffet. (It has
now been replaced by *Nines*). On
Saturdays at least they seemed to have coachloads of
Chinese tourists calling in, guess that is good business
for them.

The food was different in that it was Chinese in design,
and being a buffet one could get fed quite quickly.  It
was disconcerting one time when we were hovering, thinking
about where to eat, and the manageress almost tried to
drag us in physically.
