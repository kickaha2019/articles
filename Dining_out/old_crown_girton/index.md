*The Old Crown* used
to be famous for its very large portions.  It did
roaring business then.  Times have changed, for a
while the tenants found it very difficult to make ends
meet because of the terms forced on them by the
pub chain landlords, but at the moment [The Old Crown](https://theoldcrowngirton.com/)
seems to be surviving.

The most recent change of decor has worsened the
character for me (the pictures are some time back.)
The food isn't as special as it was a year or so
back.  But it's reasonably close, and it offers a
different menu to the other places we go.

As of late 2017 the *Old Crown* has gone seriously
up-market, and the prices reflect this. Soup comes in
a jug which gets poured into the bowl in front of you.
I wish them well but dining there is no longer a
regular part of our dining out.

In 2019 the *Old Crown* reopened and is more
reasonable. Roast lamb on Sunday can have too much fat on it.
