*The Phoenix* was a superior Chinese
restaurant in Histon where we live.  It's where
we liked to go for special occasions.  Virginia and I
did make the mistake of going there once for
Valentine's Night and found ourselves sitting in a
typing pool of tables, where we couldn't but hear
the drunks at the next table.  Usually it was a very pleasant
experience.

We often went for a set menu, partly it was cheaper, partly
it saves mental effort!  I to be different ordered the
hot and sour soup (rather than the delicious chicken
and sweetcorn) and then suffered how hot and spicy it is.

The heart of the meal for me was the crispy fried duck,
making the pancakes with plum sauce and bamboo shoots
and the duck.  Yum yum yum.

For afters I went for the Peking pancakes.  The final bill
is a tidy amount, but eating at the Phoenix was a special
experience to me.

Sadly in 2019 the Phoenix as a Chinese restaurant closed its
doors. It has been re-opened as a bar cum cafe cum restaurant
which is better than being turned into housing.
