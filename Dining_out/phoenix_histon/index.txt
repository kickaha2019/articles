Title:
	The Phoenix, Histon

Text:
	''The Phoenix'' is a superior Chinese
	restaurant in Histon where we live.  It's where
	I like to go for special occasions.  Virginia and I
	did make the mistake of going there once for
	Valentine's Night and found ourselves sitting in a
	typing pool of tables, where we couldn't but hear
	the drunks at the next table.  Usually it's a pleasant
	experience.
	
	We often go for a set menu, partly it's cheaper, partly
	it saves mental effort!  I to be different order the 
	hot and sour soup (rather than the delicious chicken
	and sweetcorn) and then suffer how hot and spicy it is.

	The heart of the meal for me is the crispy fried duck,
	making the pancakes with plum sauce and bamboo shoots
	and the duck.  Yum yum yum.

	For afters I go for the Peking pancakes.  The final bill 
	is a tidy amount, but eating at the Phoenix is a special 
	experience to me.
