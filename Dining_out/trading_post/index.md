[The Trading Post](https://www.tradingpostpub.co.uk/) is a very
reasonably priced carvery pub / restaurant with helpful young staff,
well laid out tables, and an ample car park close to where my father
was in a care home in Kettering. We would go there more often except when we visited
Dad we often went on to see my sister nearby.

Recommended.
