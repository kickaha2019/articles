	[https://www.tradingpostpub.co.uk/ The Trading Post] is a very
	reasonably priced carvery pub / restaurant with helpful young staff,
	well laid out tables, and an ample car park close to where my father
	was in a care home in Kettering. We would go there more often except when we visited
	Dad we often went on to see my sister nearby.

	Recommended.
