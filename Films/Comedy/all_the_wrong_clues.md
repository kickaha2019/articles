Plot: gangsters swindlers comic police private
detectives femme fatales ingenues homocidal
killers mayhem Al Capone in Hong Kong.

Tony Rayns hated this film, seeing it as selling
out by Tsui Hark.  This is a very commercial film,
which doesn't make it as far as a plot really let
alone social comment.  But it is a display of
scintillating style and Hark's wizardry.
