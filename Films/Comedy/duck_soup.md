Duck Soup

A Marx Bros comedy lampooning governments and nationalism and war.
Groucho Marx plays Rufus T. Firefly who becomes president of
noble country Freedonia, and leads that country to a gag-filled victory
over scheming rival country Sylvania.

Nothing is taken very seriously, everything is cue for a pun or
visual joke or song.  Even in the mime scene where Harpo pretends
to be Groucho where the mirror got broken both sides know it's not
real, it's a game inside a game.  This ludicrousness makes "Duck
Soup" a more profound commentary on the senselessness of power
politics than earnest works like Chaplin's "The Great Dictator".

The anarchy and non-sequiturs keep "Duck Soup" unpredictable to
watch, and also inspire later comedians.  A film fit for Groucho
Marx who said he would never be a member of a club that would have
him as a member.
