A comedy thriller about a withdrawn young woman who suffers
from panic attacks.  When her friend / helper leaves her for a few days
she gets accidentally caught up in a drug deal involving double-crossing
criminals and corrupt cops.

The film isn't taxing to watch, and it doesn't have a profound statement to
make.  But it is watchable, there are twists and turns, and the lead actress
makes a good heroine who comes out on top over the male malefactors.  There
are some darkly funny moments in "Miss Conspiracy".
