Plot: Michael Hui is a petty-minded manager in a
private security company.  He and his brothers
stumble through many farcical situations.

Many side-splitting moments from the driving
instruction through to the raid on the exhibition
of the jade burial suits.  As in many of Hui's films
there are moments of high suspense, and also running
gags.
