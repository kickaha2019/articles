Plot: a family are celebrating a mother's 70th
birthday in a lavish hotel in Korea when suddenly
a toxic white fog spreads through the area. The people
in the hotel manage to get to the rooftop, a helicopter
comes and rescues all but two of them: one of the mother's
sons who is a loser into rock climbing, and the deputy
manager whom he loved back when they were in a rock
climbing club. Together they try to escape by clambering
from rooftop to rooftop.

A well-made film, with very human leads in an impossible
situation. Their obstacle course is varied and treacherous,
but there are moments of triumph and comedy and
almost alien beauty. There are formulaic elements here,
the hotel manager is a slime ball, but the film is fresh
and enjoyable.

On a deeper level one could understand the film commenting
on voyeurism - the couple's desperate race for survival
thanks to drones becomes filler for news programmes,
becomes entertainment and something for the spectators to
talk about. Though as viewers we can dismiss this as fiction
nonetheless we are voyeurs, to enjoy the film we have to
enter into it, willingly suspend our disbelief, and watch
safely from our couch of armchair or beanbag.

Great film, great performances.
