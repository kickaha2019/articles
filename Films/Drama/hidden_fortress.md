Plot: in feudal Japan a loyal general tries to see
a princess and a gold treasure to safety, after a rival
state invades.  Two squabbling greedy peasants find
themselves caught up in the hazardous escape.

On one level a very conventional film about princesses
and heroic generals and villainous invaders.  But
"Hidden Fortress" transcends the genre as characters
in the film transcend the ordinary.  There is real
depth here, and the ending soars.  Kurosawa inverts
the film to tell the story from the point of view of
'minor' characters (a pair of peasants) rather than
the 'major' ones.  Ironically George Lucas when he
remade "Hidden Fortress" as the first Star Wars film
uninverted the film with R2D2 and C3PO (the peasants)
as minor comic characters.
