Plot: China after the fall of the Qing dynasty is
subject to bickering warlords.  The lives of a gold-digging musician (Cherie Chung), the patriot daughter
(Brigitte Lin) of a mercenary general, and a girl
(Sally Yeh) wanting to break into the male ranks of
Peking Opera performers intertwine.

The Chinese title (Dao Ma Dan) comes from Peking
Opera as does the spirit of the film itself.  Three
wonderful female leads.  Very funny at times gallows
humour.  Roller-coaster direction which ranges from
slapstick farce to pure poetry in motion.  A message
of the future belongs to the young.
