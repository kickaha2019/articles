Based on a manga by Sorachi Hideaki this is one crazy and crazily enjoyable film.

The plot has a white-haired ex-samurai (oh yes we're in Edo period Japan after aliens
invaded and stopped samurais waving their swords around - the aliens all have animal heads) who
gets caught up in a mystery involving a serial killing sword.

The film is choc-a-block full of references to Japanese culture, I won't have got half of them
but there's allusions to Dragon Ball Z, Rurouni Kenshin, etc. The film also breaks the
fourth wall with wild abandon, for instance pointing out that the giant white ?duck? Elizabeth
is a man in a suit.

For me this is a must-see film. Totally silly and non-serious, so bad it's great!
