A fantasy film about this heroic guy Kouga who makes a deal with
a demon to protect mankind, only the demon sets him a quest to get
a magical item from a magical land.  If heroes didn't have quests
where would we be?

There's a kind of plot in the film (to add a bit of complexity Kouga
loses his sword and cloak and ring on entering the Land of Promise so
he has to find those first before he can find the Fang of Sorrow).
Kouga rescues a dame with blue skin, confronts an evil queen in a
moving castle, and fights a dragon of darkness to save this magical
land.  So he's a little busy.

The star appeal of the film is in the fantasy setting which blends
Jim Henson's "Labyrinth" with RPG wizardry with arcade games.
The visuals are very imaginative, and playful - at times one could
be watching "Lord of the Rings" by a Peter Jackson on a trip.  That
this is a Japanese film, and not knowing the Manga? the mythos
has sprung from only adds to the bewilderment and fun as one
watches.  I like a feeling of gonzoidness.

There's a hint of more depth in the "Land of Promise" scenario -
this is a place where "things" end up that humans have forgotten.
The denizens of the "Land of Promise" are at risk of not only
being destroyed but even their names being totally forgotten.  Kouga
gives a name to one entity who becomes a comic weirdo in the
film.

Gonzoid fun.
