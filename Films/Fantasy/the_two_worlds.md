A heroic firefighter dies, and finds himself facing seven trials in the Buddhist
afterlife in order to be reincarnated. This film and its sequel are based on a
webcomic series "Singwa Hamgge" by Joo Ho-Min. Which in its turn is based on a
famous Buddhist painting "Ten Kings of Hell".

Visually spectacular in its depiction of the Buddhist hells, the film almost is
a roller-coaster ride through the afterlife. The imagination on display
overshadows the other elements of the film.

There is courtroom drama here as the three guardians helping the firefighter pass
the trials (for their own shot at reincarnation) contend with the
prosecutors. There is some comedy. The heroic firefighter may not be so much
of a paragon as it appears. Really glad I chanced upon this film on a
long-distance plane flight.
