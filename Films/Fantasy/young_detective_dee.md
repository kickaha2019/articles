Prequel to [Detective Dee And The Phantom Menace](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1123373/).
The rule of the Empress Wu is threatened by a sinister conspiracy
involving a sea dragon.  She handles the situation by assigning Detective
Dee and colleagues, encouraging them by saying if they haven't solved the
case in ten days then it's off with their heads.  That's the way to
motivate people.

*Young Detective Dee* has spectacular action scenes that alone make
the film.  A lot of wirework perhaps, but it's frenetic and
imaginative and drags you into enjoying it.  Just a question of
suspending disbelief and letting the images flow into one.  Sometimes
the computer graphics aren't quite right, but mostly it works very well,
recreating Luoyang at the height of the Tang Dynasty.

The character of Detective Dee seems to owe something to the detective
in [Wu Xia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1718199/).  Tsui Hark adds another
welcome dimension to the film here, making the Dee character not as bland
perhaps as in the first film.  There's less rivalry between
imperial factions here, the enemies are non-Chinese - read into
that what you will.
