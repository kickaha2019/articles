The best archer in Korea has to fight Chinese invaders to rescue his sister.  But
if films had complicated plots they would be incomprehensible?

As the title might indicate there is a lot of archery in this film.  Think a
Wild West film with bows and arrows rather than guns.  The set pieces are well
choreographed and dramatic. There's a good range of action as the film sweeps
around pleasant scenery.  It's just about within the bounds of the possible
rather than Jet Li flying through the air or a Colt 45 hitting the target miles
away.

There are undertones to the film which probably mean more to Koreans than to
me as a Westerner.  Korea has been subject to its powerful neighbours over the
years with much suffering.  Crossing the Yalu River meant permanent exile at some
periods in history.  Perhaps in films the downtrodden can feel a little less
downtrodden, or old wrongs can be righted.

In keeping with modern sensibilities the damsel in distress is not totally a
a plot device, or passive doll.  But necessarily the film focusses on the conflict
between the Manchu army and the lone archer. It is entertaining escapism.
