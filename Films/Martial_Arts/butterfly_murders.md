Plot: a writer seeks to record the happenings
in war-torn medieval China.  He goes to investigate
reports of homicidal butterflies at a remote castle.
His researches uncover a convoluted plot to take
control of the martial arts world.

An innovative blend of SF, horror, fantasy, and
martial arts film which was Tsui Hark's debut film.
Rooted in Chinese martial arts fiction yet defies
that tradition by having a writer as hero.  Here
bizarre devices replace Tiger Claw techniques in
the martial arts battles, with the film's McGuffin
revealed only at the end.  Surreal
images such as the castle covered in butterfly nets.
