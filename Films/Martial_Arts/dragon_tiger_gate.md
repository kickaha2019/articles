This film has a conventional plot for a Hong Kong
martial arts film.  Bad guy kills master of a kung fu
school.  Three students get trained up by mysterious
hermit.  They teach bad guy a lesson.  That's roughly it.

The setting however is not of so many Shaw films.  Instead
it's a mixture of modern-day with wu xia fiction fantastic
elements.  Donnie Yen plays the lead, and also did the
fight choreography.  Yuen Wah plays the master of the school.

Where the film really excels for is in the set-pieces.
There's a well shot fight in a restaurant with neat tracking
shots from overhead.  The opening scene in which the Lousha
token is delivered to Ma Kun then 'borrowed' is nicely
and powerfully staged.  Ma Xiaoling slapping the Lousha
gang members after the attack at the baseball ground is
powerful cinema.

Ordinary in places, but also brilliant in places.  A martial
arts film with a touch of fantasy to it.
