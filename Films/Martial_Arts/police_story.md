Directed by and stars Jackie Chan in full flow action. The plot (films tend to be saddled with them) is about a lone Hong Kong cop taking on a drug king-pin. The story provides enough excuses for great action sequences interleaved with comedy.

There are many memorable innovative sequences, from the car chase through a shanty town, through Jackie clinging onto a double decker bus by umbrella, to the glass smashing finale in a department store where our hero wins out against officialdom and the drug lord. The film is tongue-in-cheek, but the action sequences are played full on. Serious injuries were taken making this film.

Maggie Cheung suffers nobly as Chan's girl-friend, backed up by Brigitte Lin as an important witness. Significantly or not the drug lord is played by Chu Yuan an old-time director of many Shaw epics. So the ending of the film could be seen as Chan's brand of comedy action knocking out the serious films that Chan got his film start in.
