A Japanese film in a well-established vein.  A
wandering hero with a mysterious past goes around helping the
down-trodden people who are unprotected by the police and
authorities from nasty criminals.  For example the Zatoichi
films.  *Rurouni Kenshin* does not have the artiness of
Kitano Takeshi in his 2003 "Zatoichi", and it could be said
to be film-making by numbers.  But it is an
exceedingly good example of the genre, and fun to watch.

The events of *Rurouni Kenshin* are set a decade after the
battles which saw the era of the Shoguns end, and the Meiji
Restoration begin which led to Japan's modernisation.  This is
a key landmark in Japanese history, with mythic resonance.
A decade on the Samurai class have fallen on hard times, some
have adapted but many haven't.  Japan now sees the rise of
the merchant class, and our chief villain is an
unscrupulous drug-dealing capitalist.  You could see some
social comment here, perhaps the original source manga had
a political sub-text to it.

Our hero Kenshin wanders into a situation where the villain
is trying to take over the Kamiya dojo run by Kamiya's
daughter.  He is handicapped by having sworn not to kill
(his sword has the cutting edge on the wrong side.)  Will
he yet win through?

A lot of varied fights, good set-pieces.  Lone swordsmen
chopping their way through tens of opponents.  Villains
who know how to dress.  A certain amount of mysticism
around "sword-spirit".  Great.
