A 'remake' of a Shaw Bros film "Death Duel", both based on
a Gu Long wuxia fantasy novel. At times the film does have
the feel of a studio lot bound film. But it is a modern
production, with good production values, and sensible
fight choreography while still being true to wuxia fiction
and its world of wandering master swordsmen, magical swords,
clans fighting for supremacy in the Jiang Hu.

The themes of redemption, and the futility of a senseless
battle to be first, drive this film. I like films where
characters grow and change. Those themes also make the film
speak beyond its immediate setting of a martial arts
subworld in China to be more universal.

A well balanced enjoyable martial arts film.
