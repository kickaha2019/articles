Plot: the blind masseur Ichi gets involved with
a pair of geishas seeking revenge for the murder of
their parents, and also two gangs fighting for
control Yojimbo-style in a feudal Japanese town.

A masterful work by auteur Kitano.  Notice
particularly the use of sound in this film which
is appropriate given the blindness of the lead
character.  A good bit of tap dance at the end
too, besides all the sword-play.
