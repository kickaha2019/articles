 All Night Long
	
Text:
	Plot: an ill-assorted group of women suddenly find
	themselves with a pile of stolen money.  And the dead
	body of a bank robber who expired in the convenience
	store they are in.  As they try to clean up in various ways
	they contend with customers and police.  But just
	as fortune seems to be smiling the rest of the manic
	bank gang turn up . . .

	One of those films that just seems to work for me.
	Deft stylish direction.  Changes of pace and mood
	which keep things bubbling along.  Very funny and
	colourful.
