	This might seem to be another Japanese exploitation flick.  Japanese schoolgirl
	battles monster from the moon who wields a chainsaw.  These elements are
	definitely in the film.  And artistically so.  But are not what the film
	(and I assume the source manga) are about.

	The theme of the film is how to deal with feelings of loss, lack of
	self-worth, lack of significance.  A shiftless student Yosuke is trying
	to recover from the death of a friend Noto.  Yosuke steals meat more
	to do something than because he has to steal it.  One night slacker
	Yosuke comes across Eri who spends her evenings trying to kill a
	chainsaw wielding monster who falls from the moon.  He becomes 
	Eri's helper in her odd quest.

	Both Yosuke and Eri externalise their problems - is that running
	away from or part of dealing with it?  Both Yosuke and Eri find a kind of answer 
	in each other, Yosuke finds a purpose in helping Eri, Eri finds
	strength from Yosuke.  

	The key figure in the film is in a way Noto even though he's dead
	before the film begins.  Noto lived his life to extremes, followed
	Achilles in a short life but a glorious one.  Yosuke tries to
	emulate to outdo Noto but in the end only achieves moderate
	happiness.  But perhaps moderate happiness is not that bad.
