	Plot: Film based on the Disneyworld ride "Pirates of the
	Caribbean".  An Aztec curse has turned a group of
	pirates into the living dead, moonlight shows them
	for what they are - a skeleton crew.  They kidnap
	Knightley to try and end the curse because of
	a medallion she has.  Disreputable Depp and brave
	Bloom set off to rescue her.

	A stunning performance by Depp as Captain Jack
	Sparrow.  Neat imaginative writing.  Everything is
	very tongue-in-cheek.  Hollywood film-making at its
	best.  The sequels are plot-less disasters.
