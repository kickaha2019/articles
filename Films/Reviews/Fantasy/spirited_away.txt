 Spirited Away

Text:
	An
	animated film created by Hayao Miyazaki.  A Japanese family move
	from the city into the suburbs, and blunder through a tunnel into
	a leisure centre for demons and spirits.  The parents are turned into
	pigs after gobbling up the witchy food, and 10-year old Chihiro
	finds herself working in the strangest bathhouse as she searches
	for a way to change her parents back.

	The animation is old school compared with the computer animation
	Hollywood produces.  But perhaps because of this ''Spirited Away''
	more easily transports us into a magical world, where the
	fantastic makes sense.  The images and events in ''Spirited Away''
	are highly imaginative, and the storyline unpredictable.  The film
	on the surface may be a fable for children, but speaks to adults too.

	One theme in the film is Chihiro coming to terms with moving away
	from the city into the suburbs, her emotional journey.  Another
	theme is family, and discovering how important that is.

	Ecology is an important theme in a number of Ghibli's films.  The
	bathhouse speaks of physical cleansing, but also of spiritual
	cleansing too.  Chihiro wins through by being herself, by acting
	as a catalyst for change, not by force.
	
	''Spirited Away'' is not only one of the greatest cartoon films
	ever produced, it is one of the greatest films ever produced.
