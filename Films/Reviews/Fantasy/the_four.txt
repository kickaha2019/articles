 The Four
	
Text:
	A film loosely based on
	a 1970s wuxia series by Wen Ruian.  The film adds fantasy elements into the
	original stories, and is in the same area as Tsui Hark's "Detective Dee" film.
	Also similar to another Tsui Hark film ("Flying Swords of Dragon Gate") are the
	effective tracking shots which show how technically able Chinese film-making is.
	
	The plot of the film is about conspiracies in Imperial China, rivalries between
	different security services, mixed with necromancy and nastiness.  A rich stew
	of ideas but well stirred and presented.  "The Four" has a decent villain with
	some good lines.  I like a decent villain.
	
	The strengths of the film lie in the world it depicts as much as the story and
	characters.  The mechanical contrivances that Merciless has in the Divine
	Constabulary, the recreation of bygone Chinese streets and inns and waterways,
	the tableau of the various confrontations of the characters.  You could say
	there are Matrix style moments such as when Merciless stops a load of darts in midair.
	Or even a steampunk influence on the steam driven machines.  But this is
	a film to sit back and enjoy, not to over analyse.
	
	The English translation I saw was slightly wonky.  So Merciless gets rendered as
	Emotionless which isn't as effective as a name.  But I'm used to the English
	sub-titles being unintentionally interesting in Far East movies.  There are apparently
	sequels in the works and I'm looking forward to them.
