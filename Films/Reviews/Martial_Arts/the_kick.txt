Text:
	 A film directed by Prachya Pinkaew of "Ong Bak" and "Chocolate" renown.  Instead of Muy Thai the fighting style featured is Taekwondo, but apart from that this is another varied martial arts film.

	The plot has a Korean family who are into Taekwondo who by chance foil the theft of a valuable ceremonial knife.  The robbers kidnap the young son, the family have to steal the knife to get the son back.  That's enough to justify plenty of fight scenes.  The final battle takes place in a zoo so we also get elephants and crocodiles.

	There is some humour amid the athletics.  The fights are impressive, a range of settings to avoid boredom, but while crowd-pleasing there isn't the depth of "Ong Bak" and "Chocolate".  More could have been done with some of the characters, the villains are one-dimensional.  But a pleasant and fun watch.
