 The Lady Vanishes

Text:
	Plot: spy thriller where Margaret Lockwood's
	character wakens on a train to find her
	elderly companion missing, and everyone denying
	she even existed.  Is she a pathological liar?
	Hallucinating?  Or beneath civility and ordinariness
	does there hide dark mystery?

	A good mix of unsettling suspense, comedy (two of the
	minor characters Charters and Caldicott appeared in
	other films,) and drama.
