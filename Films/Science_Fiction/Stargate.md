"Stargate" is a film that continues to spawn TV series as the idea of a 'stargate' has proved to be a useful story device. The plot has a mysterious device found in an archaeological dig in Egypt which proves to be a portal to a strange world. In this world live the descendants of ancient Egyptians transplanted to be slaves for the androgynous Ra. The team sent through the portal find themselves opposing Ra and his superior technology.

'Stargate' wins on a number of counts. Perhaps it's a B-film adventure but it successfully mixes elements like 'Chariots of the Gods', and Ancient Egypt, and army / civilian drama. Not to any great depth, just enough for a film. The characters do undergo some change and growth. Fun.
