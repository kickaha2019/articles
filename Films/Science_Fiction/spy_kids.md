Plot: Carmen and Juni Cortez have no idea their
parents are master spies.  But when their parents
are captured by Fegan Floop, who plans to take
over the world with robot children, they have to
suddenly become spy kids and go on a rescue
mission.

A children's movie perhaps, with gadgets galore,
Fegan Floop's fantasy fortress, and Rodriguez's
showy direction.  It has a message about the
importance of being family which might have been
preachy.  But this is clever fun well worth
an adult watching.
