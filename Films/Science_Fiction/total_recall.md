A film inspired by a story by Philip K.
Dick.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's role suits his
acting style.

The plot has a construction worker discovering he is in fact a spy
with a vital secret about Mars and aliens which the bad guys will
go to any lengths to suppress.  Or the plot is about a construction
worker who has a memory implant about being a spy with a vital
secret which leaves him lost inside his own mind.  The film
deliberately does not force either interpretation, both are valid.

"Total Recall" rattles along at high speed, not taking itself too
seriously.  The set-pieces and plot twists are like a roller-coaster
ride.  Verhoeven was given enough leeway to create a world for the
story to take place in, and a vivid world it is.  The effects are
dated, now so much would be done with computer graphics, but it is
still very watchable 20 years on.

Personally I view the film as Arnie has lost his mind to the memory
implant.
