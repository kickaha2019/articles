A collision between "Alien" and "Predator" and
Japanese Ninja films which is
so bad and risible and tacky and lacking in sense that it merits
cult status.

The plot has this alien coming to earth and killing people.
A ninja clan try to kill the alien. Got it?

Many wondrous moments include extracting the alien's offspring
from human hosts, the cave fight with alien, and the hero
safely leaping to earth after dealing with the unwanted
immigrant to Japan at the end.

Watch in total disbelief!
