Tasteless comic film exploitation.  The plot has a disgraced
company chemist seeking revenge by turning sushi into flying
homocidal delicacies with teeth and nerves.  The karate idol
Rina Takeda stars as the trainee sushi chef who must use her
karate moves to deal with the onslaught of raw fish wrapped in
rice.

What "Dead Sushi" lacks in taste and sense it makes up for in
inventiveness.  It is in the vein of "Attack of the Killer
Tomatoes", it's no way close to being family friendly
entertainment, but if you like watching trash then this is
quality trash.
