A low budget zombie film is being shot in an abandoned factory
as well as it can be with constant arguments between the crew
and actors. However the factory was used for human experiments in
WW2, and real zombies turn up to turn make belief into the truth.
The director sees a big opportunity and carries on shooting
seeking to make his perfect film.

Very much an indie low budget film but a very clever and very
funny film. One of those films where you have to watch it through
to get it. In its way the film is not about zombies but about film
making itself, and the pain and pressure of so doing. I am a sucker for films
within films.
