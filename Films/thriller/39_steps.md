Plot: loose adaptation of the Buchan espionage
thriller.  Colonial Richard Hannay finds himself
embroiled in a melodramatic spy story - is pursued
to the Highlands of Scotland blamed for a murder
he didn't commit - stumbles into the den of a
German master spy who tries to kill him -
gets handcuffed to an
attractive blonde - uncovers the mystery of the
39 Steps at a finale at a London Music Hall.

Has Hitchcock's fingerprints all over this film.
Good interplay between the leads.  Restrained and
effective playing by the support characters.  Neat
set pieces.  Film-making that works.
