"Atlantis 4: Evolution" (2004) is the fourth game in the Atlantis series originally
from the French game developer Cryo.  An American off a sinking tramp steamer gets
sucked through a whirlpool into a world inside the Earth.  Here survivors of
the old Atlantis are ruled by cruel Gods.  You must ascend to their
new Olympus and topple them.

The images are striking and beautiful, and the story does transport you
from mundane old Earth into realms and time of wonder - you travel back
in time to Old Atlantis on your quest.  You meet plenty of characters
including the subservient Atlanteans who address you as Cosmo, God of
Death, and say they're waiting to be obliterated.

The version I played (from Anuman) has been dumbed down.  I welcomed the
absence of the arcade sequences from the original, but the puzzles were
not taxing.  Still it was fun to play.
