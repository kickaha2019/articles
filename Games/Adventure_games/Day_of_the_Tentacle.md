*Day of the Tentacle* is a 1993 LucasArts game, back in the days when
LucasArts were turning out Adventure game classics. Written by Tim Schafer and
Dave Grossman, it has been recently been remasted by 
[Double Fine Productions](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/doublefine?snr=1_5_9__2000)
and I played it on an iPad.

*Day of the Tentacle*  is an old-school, 2D cartoon graphics comic game. 
The plot is about a purple tentacle who imbibes some toxic waste and decides
to take over the world (as one does). You play as three different characters in
three time periods trying to avert humanity's doom at the hands (well it would be
hands if tentacles had hands) of the purple tentacle. The mansion most of the
game takes place in is differently realised in each time period, from 200 years ago to 
today to 200 years in the future under tentacle rule. The writing and situations are
richly funny.

The puzzles are fair, and listening to all that's said will often point towards the solutions.
The game play in one time period can impact another. There are no timed puzzles
or puzzles requiring dexterity. The savegames indicate how far through
the game you are.

A classic game. Sadly they rarely make them like that any more.
