"Egypt 3: The Egyptian Prophecy" (2004) is the third game in the Egypt series
from the French game developer Cryo.  You play a young magician Maya
charged with making sure an obelisk is erected for Amun-Re, so that
Amun-Re will give Pharaoh Ramses some more years of life.  But you
are opposed by mysterious forces.

Maya goes on an incredible journey through Egyptian mythology, as well
as temples and quarries.  She will visit Ptah in the underworld as well
as Osiris in the Book of the Dead.  This is what I like a game to do, to
transport from the mundane to realms of wonder.  The gameplay may be
linear but it didn't feel constrained.  There are timed sequences but
in the iPad version you get second chances.

The puzzles are mostly inventory based - the final puzzle from the
original game has been omitted, as far as I remember it was almost a board
game with snakes.  You meet plenty of characters including the Gods of
Ancient Egypt.  Sometimes the dialogue doesn't reflect what you've
done.

Very pleasant play!
