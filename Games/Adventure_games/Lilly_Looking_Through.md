[Lilly Looking Through](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/516151670/lilly-looking-through-an-animated-adventure-game)
([Geeta Games](http://geetagames.com)
2013) is the first Kickstarter funded Adventure game I've played!  And a great
first Kickstarter game too.

You guide Lilly through a series of charming whimsical fantasy scenes
to rescue her brother.  Early on Lilly gains a pair of goggles which
gives her an alternate view of the scene she's in.  Using these goggles
is key to solving some of the Myst style puzzles (one of the people behind
Geeta Games worked for Cyan).  There's no inventory to speak of, solving
the puzzles requires experimentation and observation and leaps of thought.
The puzzles aren't impossible, but are hard enough to give a sense of
accomplishment as Lilly moves forward.

The backdrops are lovingly envisaged and drawn.  Slightly jarring is that
Lilly and her brother don't visually match, the characters are plainer and
simpler.  The game menu is artistic, but only saves at the end of each
episode.  If you quit halfway through an episode you will have to replay
all of it.  There wasn't any way I found to click through the cutscenes
which could be lengthy.

What the red ribbon represents I'm not sure - it whisks Lilly's brother
away at the start of the game.  There's a puzzling encounter near the end.
The game finishes oddly almost suggesting a sequel.

A beautiful game set in childhood dream vistas, with solid
mechanical puzzles to be teased and explored.
