**Zork Grand Inquisitor** (1997) is a classic Adventure game (both in years and status).
You are an unnamed anonymous Adventurer tasked with restoring
to the the land after it has been banished by the Grand Inquisitor (a 
glorious performance by Erick Avari). You have to find three magic objects
(three's a good number) to do so.

**Zork Grand Inquisitor** is an older game. The resolution is limited, it's 
not 3D or VR. When I started playing it did feel cramped and retro but
after a while, as I got into the puzzles and story I got used to the
resolution and didn't mind. Your mileage may vary.

The game is very much descended from text adventures - not having
played the original Zork games there's references I will have missed.
But the humour and outlandish settings appealed to me a lot.
If they still made games like this I would still play them.

The puzzles are fair, and inventive - particularly how you use the
spells you pick up as you play. The ending is very pleasing as you get 
to use the spell you haven't yet used. Some of the puzzles require 
out of the box thinking, and give a real sense of
accomplishment. The game is not super hard.

A classic game indeed.
