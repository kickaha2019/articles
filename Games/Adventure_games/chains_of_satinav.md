[The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav](https://www.daedalic.com/)
(Daedalic Entertainment 2012) is set in a fantasy land with magic and portals
to lands of faerie.  Geron, a humble bird catcher, goes on a long quest to
return a fairy Nuri back to her home so the evil Seer won't use her to
further his nefarious plans.

A very traditional point and click Adventure game.  You move from location
to location as you solve puzzles.  Most of the locations are almost
single scene with only one or two problems to solve, but some locations are
bigger with involved multiple problems.  I solved the game without a
walkthrough but I felt the good story motivated me to continue on some
of the harder puzzles.

The game is generously long, with plenty of characters to meet, and
lovingly drawn scenes.  Just when I thought the game had finished there
was a sudden twist, and Geron was where he didn't expect to be.  And it
was there that the puzzles were at their best, fantastical and magical.

The characters have minimal lip synching and facial animation, but I
got used to that.  Sometimes the game mechanics are a bit odd, being
thorough as with any game helps.  Geron is not a saint, and makes some
choices which have repercussions.

Great.  They do still make them like that!
