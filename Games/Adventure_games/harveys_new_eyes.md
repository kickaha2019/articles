[Edna and Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes](https://www.daedalic.com/games)
(Daedalic Entertainment 2013) is the 'sequel' to
to *Edna and Harvey: The Breakout*.  This time the player guides
angelic little Lilli in her odyssey to defeat nefarious Doctor
Marcel and his master plan.  *Harvey's New Eyes* is a rich game
in terms of the different situations, and the imagination that has gone
into it.  It also has very black humour.  So highly recommended
on that score.

As with the first game *The Breakout* how you choose to interpret
what's going on is up to you.  Who's mad?  Is this all a dream?
I'm not going to venture an opinion.

One or two of the puzzles defy rational explanation and I resorted to
a walkthrough - as we have games within games here (so you play a
RPG at one point) the game is probably having game with the player.

The game is not a consistent whole - so the first section where Lilli
has to escape the convent is one part which doesn't mesh with the
next section where Lilli is getting to the asylum.  Which doesn't mesh
with the third section actually in the asylum itself.

Brilliant and bewildering.
