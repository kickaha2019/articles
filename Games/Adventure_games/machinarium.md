[Machinarium](http://amanita-design.net/games/machinarium.html)
([Amanita Games](http://amanita-design.net/)
2009) is set in a wonderful mechanical city of robots. There's no spoken dialogue, but none is needed as you help your robot save the day. The imaginative setting offers a reflection on our world and foibles. The game is worth playing for the scenes you see alone.

The gameplay is mainly traditional inventory-based Adventure gameplay, but has two arcade sequences. "Machinarium" is implemented in Flash, and the user interface is at times a bit clunky. There are inbuilt hints, and also a help system - which oddly has to be accessed by beating an arcade game so I found it unusable. The puzzles hark back to the golden age of Adventure games, and are nicely non-trivial.

The robot has to be within reach of a hotspot before the cursor will indicate it is a hotspot. Particularly when holding inventory items it can be unclear that the game is indicating an interaction is possible. The robot only has a few places in each scene he will stand in.
