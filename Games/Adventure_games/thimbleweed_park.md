[Thimbleweed Park](https://thimbleweedpark.com/) (2017) is a Kickstarted
retro Adventure game created by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick.
It is retro in its look (pixelated and limited colour palette), and also
game interface (you choose verbs at the bottom to interact with the game).
It is also retro in being a traditional point and click Adventure, of
the kind no longer made. In keeping with the times it does have
a casual mode, and Steam achievements. And it also a good built-in
hint system which I confess I made use of.

It is very self-referential, and fourth-wall breaking in keeping
with the genre. And funny.

I enjoyed playing [Thimbleweed Park](https://thimbleweedpark.com/). The puzzles were fair (in hindsight),
and varied. You play as different characters which adds to the variety.
A delicious nostalgic trip.
