"The Gardens Between" (
[The Voxel Agents](https://thegardensbetween.com/)
2018) is a beautiful puzzle game in which you guide a couple of children through a series
of islands. The islands are populated with toys and TVs and sinks and childhood memories.
Even without solving the puzzles there is a lot of imagination to wonder at.

There is a small story here, a large one to the children, the ending is foreshadowed in
the opening. But the main draw here are the game worlds (islands?) and the puzzles
to be solved.

The game mechanic is novel to me. As a player you either go forward or backwards in
time and see what happens, sometimes touching switches or moving a light key to your
progress. The puzzles go from simple to rewarding to solve, puzzles which require
careful observation of what happens as you manipulate time.

I felt I was robbing those who made this game by paying so little to play it
on my iPad.
