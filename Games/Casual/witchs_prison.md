"Nightmare Adventures: Witch's Prison" (
[Ghost Ship Studios](http://www.ghostshipstudios.com/)
2010) is a Adventure-lite casual game in which you guide the heroine to the heart of the mystery in Arkham Asylum. This isn't horror as such but there is a macabre edge to many of the scenes.

The game is well produced - user friendly, well drawn. The characters are not voiced but I didn't miss that. The puzzles range from using inventory items to standalone puzzles like sliders. There was only one what I would call a hidden object puzzle, and that was optional I think. As such this is a good game for Adventurers to play who bemoan the death of Adventure games.

The story is a journey to the Heart of Darkness, but perhaps the game needed to be longer to fully develop that journey. The ending of the game might hint at a sequel, if there was one I would certainly play it. As with many Adventure games disbelief needs to be suspended as one comes across the puzzles in the Asylum. One of the great puzzles I remember in "Zork Grand Inquisitor" is the one you solve with brute force rather than cleverness.

A nice play. Recommended.
