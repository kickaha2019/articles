Text:
	The ''textall'' command is similar to the ''Text'' command
	save that it sets a variable to all the concatenated texts
	inside the current element on the HTML page.  An example:
	
Code:
	next A
	textall LinkText
	log LinkText

Text:
	this will log the text for the next ''A'' element even if the
	text is embedded inside a ''SPAN'' element say.
