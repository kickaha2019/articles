Text:
	The ''call'' command executes a sub-branch, continuing with
	the following commands in the script for each successful
	completion of the sub-branch.  So the
	script lines:
	
Code:
	call Fred
	log Link
		
Text:
	where branch ''Fred'' is defined as:
	
Code:
	branch Fred
		every A
		attribute href Link

Text:
	would result in each link URL in the current HTML document (from the
	current position) being logged.  ''call'' is different to ''run'' which
	would fully explore branch ''Fred'' then carry on in the script as
	though ''Fred'' had not been called.
