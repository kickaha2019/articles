	The ''expect'' script command is used to check that a sequence of script
	commands works as intended.  It is used to guard against the structure of
	a website changing, or bugs in a script, meaning that elements being
	scanned for are not found.
	
	An example:
	
Code:
	expect Site Type "Broken Sword II - The Smoking Mirror" "Broken Sword II - The Smoking Mirror" Base+"walkthroughs/BrokenSwordII/index.htm" 
	url "http://mysterymanor.net/walkthroughs.htm"
	every A
	attribute href Url
	match Url "walkthroughs/.*"
	text Title 
	write Site Type Title Title Base+Url

	Here the ''expect'' command checks that a walkthrough for the 2nd Broken Sword game
	is found on the Mystery Manor website.
	
	The ''expect'' command works by executing the following script commands, checking
	for writes matching the arguments to the ''expect'' command.  If no such writes
	are found then an error is raised when the ''expect'' command backtracks.
