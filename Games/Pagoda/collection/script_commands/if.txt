Text:
	The ''if'' and ''endif'' commands surround a block of script commands.
	If the script commands succeed to the final ''endif'' then the script 
	commands after the ''endif'' will be executed for each success.  If
	the script commands do not succeed then the script commands after the
	''endif'' will be executed as though the ''if'' ''endif'' block
	didn't exist.
	
	An example:
	
Code:
	set Link "Blah"
	if
		every A
		attribute href Link
		match Link "reviews/.*"
	endif
	log Blah
		
Text:
	If there are links where the URL matches "reviews/.*" then they will
	be logged.
	
	If there are not such links then a single "Blah" will be logged.
