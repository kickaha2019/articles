Text:
	The ''match'' script command only succeeds if the first argument matches
	a given regular expression.
	
	An example:
	
Code:
	every A
	attribute href Url
	match Url "walkthroughs/.*"
	text Title 
	write Site Type Title Title Base+Url 

Text:
	Here only those links starting with "walkthroughs/.*" are written out.
