Text:
	The ''matchnot'' script command only succeeds if the first argument doesn't match
	a given regular expression.  So it is the opposite of the ''Match'' command.
	
	An example:
	
Code:
	every A
	attribute href Link
	matchnot Link ".*'.*"
	text Title
	write Site Type Title Title Base+Link

Text:
	Here only those links not containing a "'" (apostrophe) are written out.
