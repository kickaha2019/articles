Text:
	The ''previous'' script command is like the ''Next'' command save that
	it's the previous element not the next element with a given tag 
	that it tries to find.
	
	An example:
	
Code:
	every A
	attribute href Link
	previous H3
	text Title
	log Link Title

Text:
	Here all the links from the current position are logged, but with the
	title from the H3 element before each link.
