Text:
	The ''prune'' script command stops looping over elements from an ''Every'' or
	similar command.  It's used to abandon a search when certain conditions have
	been satisfied.
	
	An example:
	
Code:
	every A
	attribute href Link
	match Link "reviews/.*"
	prune
	log Link

Text:
	This will log the first link found which is a review link.
