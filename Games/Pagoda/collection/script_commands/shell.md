The *shell* command runs a command to generate a HTML page, and
	loads that page into the context, positioning at the first
	element on the page.

The *shell* command takes an optional parameter for a number
	of days to cache the HTML page generated by the command.

An example:

~~~
shell "echo '<title>Shell output</title>'" 50
next TITLE
text Title
log Title
~~~

This would log *Shell output*.

The command is only re-executed if 50 days has elapsed
	since the last time it was run.
