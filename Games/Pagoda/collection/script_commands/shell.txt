Text:
	The ''shell'' command runs a command to generate a HTML page, and 
	loads that page into the context, positioning at the first
	element on the page.
	
	The ''shell'' command takes an optional parameter for a number
	of days to cache the HTML page generated by the command.
	
	An example:
	
Code:
	shell "echo '<title>Shell output</title>'" 50
	next TITLE
	text Title
	log Title

Text:
	This would log ''Shell output''.
	
	The command is only re-executed if 50 days has elapsed
	since the last time it was run.
