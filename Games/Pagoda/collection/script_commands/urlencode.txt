Text:
	The ''urlencode'' command escapes the special characters in
	a text string for going into a URL.

	So the command:
	
Code:
	urlencode "Articles/Website/articles/article_files/centre.html" encoded

Text:
	will result in ''encoded'' being set to ''Articles%2FWebsite%2Farticles%2Farticle_files%2Fcentre.html''.
