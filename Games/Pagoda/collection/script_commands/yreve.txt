Text:
	The ''yreve'' script command is similar to the ''Every'' command
	save that it loops backward in the HTML document, not forward.
	
	An example:
	
Code:
	yreve A
	attribute href Link
	log Link

Text:
	This will log out all the links before the current position in the HTML document,
	going backwards.
