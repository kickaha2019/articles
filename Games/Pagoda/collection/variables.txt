	Variables only take string values.  A number of commands will set
	values for variables.  The ''Set'' command can concatenate variables to
	give a new value.  So for instance:
	
Code:
	set H "Hello"
	set W "World"
	set HW H+" "+W
	log HW
	
Text:
	Will log "Hello World".  The ''Match'' command can be used to extract 
	strings from inside other strings.
	
	The values of variables only persist on the context passed to
	script commands after the variable is set.  So the commands:
	
Code:
	every A
	attribute href Link
	log Link
	set Link "Blah"
	log Link
	
Text:
	Results in the link followed by "Blah" being
	logged for each A element.
