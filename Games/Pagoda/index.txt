	[http://www.pagodagamedatabase.com Pagoda] is an online database
	of links relating to Adventure games that I've created and
	maintain.  The initial reason I did was I wanted to find where
	I could buy a given Adventure game, but [Pagoda] now has a life 
	of its own.  I'm encouraged to continue by occasionally hearing
	of people using [Pagoda] to find information about games.

	Please see ''Backlog'' where I list possible changes to [Pagoda]
	and ask for feedback.

	I've tried several times to classify the games listed in [Pagoda]
	but each time found the exercise problematic.  A number of
	websites have their own schemes of classification and good for them.
	Recently I've added into [Pagoda] the concept of a group of 
	games which is at least a better defined concept.  From a lot of
	reviews it's hard to glean what a game is like.  For instance
	some reviewers won't mention if a game has arcade sequences.

	[Pagoda] is maintained by scanning a number of websites for links
	to reviews and walkthroughs etc, then matching those links to 
	games already in the database.  New games are added as found.

	Challenges are variant names for games (for example "Atlantis 2" 
	being also known as "Beyond Atlantis").  And when websites decide
	to restructure themselves which they're at perfect liberty to
	do, it just causes me to have to redo that part of my database.
