*Blackguards*
([Daedalic Entertainment](https://www.daedalic.com/?lang_new=en) 1993)
is a turn-based RPG set in
The Dark Eye world of Aventuria, setting for Daedalic's Adventure
games
*The Chains of Satinav* and
*Memoria* which I previously
enjoyed so much.  The main story is about a bunch of misfits stopping
a supernatural cataclysm, partly told with flashbacks.

One great aspect of *Blackguards* is the balance of story and
gameplay, there's less of a feeling of mining as there is in many
RPGs to get your characters stronger.  Each battle comes with a dollop of
story, and though there may be fewer battles than other RPGs the battles
tend to be larger in scope and significantly give your characters the
equivalent of XP.

There's a great variety of battles too, requiring a range of strategies
and abilities to succeed.  From the word go how you develop and arm your
characters is important - in passing I found customising one's character
at the start better than using one of the precooked characters.  There is
a sense of achievement when you win the battles, you haven't just gone
through the motions as you do when mining in other RPGs.

The ruleset used is different to other RPGs, as is how you use the XP (here
called Adventure points).  Understanding the ruleset is key to doing well,
there is some explanation of it.  You can enhance your character at any time
using the Adventure points, there isn't levelling up as in many RPGs.

On the downside there are times when you find yourself in a sequence of
battles, more or less unexpectedly.  Until you've gone through once you
don't know the strategy to follow - this is a bit unfair.  At times the
graphics misbehave, the dead don't lie down properly.  What you can do or
ought to do can be non-obvious.  Perhaps something is lost in translation.

This is a very addictive game, so addictive I've started playing it again to
see if I can get a better ending!
