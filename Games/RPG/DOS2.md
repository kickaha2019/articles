[Divinity: Original Sin 2](https://divinity.game/)
([Larian Studios](https://larian.com/) 2017) is a
turn-based RPG set in the fantasy land of Rivellon. You play
a Sourcerer (person able to manipulate the magic of Source)
on your way to be 'cured' of this ability. You need to escape and
discover the truth behind the crusade to rid Rivellon of
undesirables like you.

A very strong story, with plenty of meaty side-quests. Unlike
many RPGs the battles go hand in hand with puzzles that
could grace an Adventure game. I didn't play the game on the
hardest level, but to me it felt challenging and rewarding enough to beat the
game. It also felt well balanced. I don't like to spend effort crafting
for one thing. I won through the game playing in Lone Wolf mode
which meant I had a squad of 2 game characters not 4. This did mean
some quests were not available to me, but I preferred the
sense of having stronger characters.

I may well replay this with different character builds. It's a very good
game.
