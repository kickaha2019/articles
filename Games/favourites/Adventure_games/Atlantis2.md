"Atlantis 2: Beyond Atlantis" (1999) is the second game in the Atlantis series from the now defunct French game developer Cryo.  The story is written by Jehan K. Robson who blends different cultures while yet
honouring them.

There are three worlds where you will play most of the game. You will be an Irish monk on an island trying to resolve
issues for the pre-Christian deities. You will be a Mayan soldier trying to avoid the Jaguar God becoming
supreme, and ushering in an age of bloodshed. You will be a Chinese scholar trying to find an immortal to help 
deal with a monster.

The places you will travel to are literally out of this world, you are tripping out. The imagination and
artistry of the game developers is stellar. What you have to do in each situation makes sense from the
cultural setting you are.

The puzzles are traditional Adventure game puzzles, no action or timed puzzles though the spider web
may feel otherwise. Some of the puzzles are off the wall to put it mildly. Some of them can have a high
frustration value - the crossing the Rainbow bridge did for me. I needed a walkthrough.

A beautiful game, a shame they don't make them like that any more.
