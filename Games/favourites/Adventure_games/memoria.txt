	''Memoria'' (2013) from [https://www.daedalic.com/ Daedalic Entertainment]
	is the sequel to
	to ''Chains of Satinav''.  Geron's fairy and friend Nuri
	is now a raven after the events of the first game.  A merchant 
	promises to turn Nuri back if Geron solves a riddle about a long-dead
	princess called Sadja.  But Geron does not know where his quest will
	lead to.

	''Memoria'' is a very similar game to ''Chains of Satinav''.  Plenty of
	puzzles and locations and characters to explore.  Traditional point
	and click Adventure with 2D graphics.  You play as both Geron in the
	present and Princess Sadja in the past.  The puzzles are not casual
	walkovers, but are not impossible either.  Hard enough to give me a
	warm glow of accomplishment at times.
	
	The artwork is beautiful and elegiac, the music too is sad and
	haunting as befits the story of Sadja on her quest for a glorious death.
	There is a nice variation of puzzles, and reasonable sized locations
	to explore.

	The story is the star of the game.  A rich and surprising tale with a 
	real twist in the tale.  ''Memoria'' ends well, but a number of threads
	have loose ends.  Best game I've played for some time!
