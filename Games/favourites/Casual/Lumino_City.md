"Lumino City" (
[State of Play](http://www.luminocitygame.com/)
2015) sees you guiding Lumi on a quest to find her missing grandfather. The star
of this game is the setting - Lumi has to puzzle her way through Lumino City
which is a wonderful whimsical concoction of model making and origami.
Truly a different place to visit.

The puzzles are a varied batch of fix or manipulate this machine, with the
aim of restoring power to Lumino City so Lumi can progress. Lumi has a
backpack but there are minimal inventory puzzles.

Lumi's progress is very linear, and the next puzzle is fairly obvious. The
game has a very good hint system built in, but you may have to turn a lot
of pages in the manual which is a work of art in itself. There is enough
cleverness here to please adults as well as children.
