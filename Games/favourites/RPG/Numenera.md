[Torment: Tides of Numenera](https://www.inxile-entertainment.com/torment)
([InXile Entertainment](https://www.inxile-entertainment.com/) 2017) is a
turn-based RPG set in a far far distant future. You're the last
castoff of the Changing God, magical devices from previous
civilisations known as numenera make the impossible possible,
but you are being hunted by an implacable force called the
Shadow.

A very imaginative game in a very imaginative setting.
Beautifully balanced gameplay so even less able players like me
can get to the satisfying poignant ending. Most situations have
multiple solutions, and the game is very forgiving.

A rich spectrum of characters to be encountered, and realms to
travel to. This is described as a descendant of the classic
"Planescape: Torment".

There is a philosophical streak to this game, the writers have
tried to make a narrative you can think deeply about. For me
some of the elements like the Tides didn't come that well
together, your mileage may vary.

Tremendous game.
