[Shadowrun Returns](http://harebrained-schemes.com/games/)
([Harebrained Schemes](http://harebrained-schemes.com/) 2013) is a traditional
turn-based isometric 3rd person RPG game. The game is not as glossy as some
other RPGS, the graphics have a well tried look, but it's very playable
and fun.

The setting for the game is interesting, blending both magic and science.
I played as a mage, but there's other options like deckers who can enter
a cyber world.  The story is definitely noir, involving people being
killed for body parts and corporate corruption and crime bosses.

The storyline is very linear, but acceptable. There's lots of character
interaction and dialogue. I got quite into it, there's a lot of
options in how you can evolve your character yet I managed to
complete the game.

People say the *Dragonfall* expansion is even better (this is a
full blown game more than an expansion) so I'll definitely try that!
