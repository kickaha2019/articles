	[Wasteland 2]
	([InXile Entertainment] 2014) is a
	turn-based RPG set in a post apocalypse America. Your squad of
	Desert Rangers have to deal with wacko cults, lawless criminals,
	homocidal robots, vicious vegetation, and ambitious androids.

	The game has a lot of areas to explore, plenty of side quests (I've
	left many undone for when I replay), a neat selection of weaponry
	which you will upgrade as the game progresses. The rocketry is
	particularly sweet to use, but I saved it for the endgame.

	Unlike some RPGs ''Wasteland 2'' is quite playable by less
	experienced RPG gamers like me. It is well balanced, offering
	worthwhile gameplay on easy levels and I think a challenge on the
	harder levels. There is plenty of variety in the fights so
	it never feels like repetitive mining to gain XP.

	The writing is solid and substantial. Impressive is the branching
	right at the beginning, where you either save Highpool or the Ag
	Centre. Your choice is reflected in the dialogue and events following,
	creating a sense of involvement and interaction. There's a lot of
	back stories and situations to explore.

	A great contribution to the turn-based RPGs now being produced
	which keep this genre alive.
