blurb: I like playing graphic Adventure games and turn-based RPGs on the computer
---
Computer games are a big interest of mine, an intersection of
complex software and art and puzzle and story.  Yes, I would call
computer games as Art even if not everyone would.  I really
got hooked after a work colleague lent me the first Monkey
Island game.  For what I like the most see *favourites*, what one
likes is very subjective.

So I not only play but I also write the occasional *review*,
*interview*, and *article* for websites.  Some of
what I've written in the past make me cringe now!

I maintain a website *Pagoda* which is a database of links for
different Adventure and casual games.  Originally meant to help
me find where to buy games, I haven't got out of the habit of
maintaining it.

To add to my guilt I also try to write *games*.  Everyone
needs a hobby to stay sane.
