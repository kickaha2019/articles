	3:HTML5 Canvas

	A key new element in HTML5 is the [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp canvas].  
	This allows drawing graphics in Javascript as one can through
	say the 2D graphics API available in Java for instance.

	In ''Card 2013'' I'm using the HTML5 Canvas for the hint meter (on 
	the hidden object scenes it's at the right hand end of the status
	bar at the bottom).  In particular for drawing the circle showing
	how the hint meter is recharging.  And also for drawing the
	circles when the hint meter is pressed.

	Perhaps I could use the canvas alone rather than the mix of 
	HTML4 elements like IMG and DIV and TD that I do use.  Not sure.
	But the canvas element enables adhoc drawing which it wouldn't be
	possible otherwise to do.
