	A late fix was done for the Finale screen, where the soft
	toys would start appearing before the screen was visible.
	This problem was made worse by how long it takes to load
	all the images for the Finale screen in particular.

	Preloading was introduced to the code which after
	a screen is fully displayed then seeks to load some
	images in the background to speed up moving to the
	next screen when that happens.  We rely on the browser itself
	caching images, and loading them behind the scenes.

	I did think about reducing the size of some of the 
	images by converting the PNGs to be JPGs, and in
	Javascript doing some editing.  Silly idea.  The
	Christmas tree on the final scene was two PNGs but
	I merged it with the background to give two smaller
	JPGs.
