	''Words'' will be a lot of pages of words to read. What background
	to display these words over has occupied a lot of my time. My first
	thought was to go for something similar to the inside of the crystal
	skull ''Atlantis 3'' but I didn't the skill or artistry for it,
	and it would have have overpowered the text in front.

	So my next thought was to generate artifical landscapes in something
	like [https://www.daz3d.com/bryce Bryce], perhaps in weirdly shaped worlds
	like something out of Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer. I spent time
	on trying to use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise Perlin noise]
	to generate height maps. Again such a backdrop would have drowned
	the foreground text. Thoughts kept coming, about wavering Escher
	staircases or Margritte apples and umbrellas bobbing around.

	The next serious thought came when I watched a music video for
	the Japanese electronica group [Perfume].
	This video had the camera moving through wifeframe buildings -
	I thought this might work as a background, it wouldn't dominate
	the foreground. So I wrote Ruby code which extracted lines from
	models inside [https://www.sketchup.com Sketchup], and generated
	Javascript code to draw them using the HTML5 canvas.

	This managed to draw lines but it wasn't as delicate as I would
	like. I had to thicken the lines to avoid pixellation as the lines
	rotated. It also wasn't fast enough - even after optimisation it
	still ate up the CPU on our iMac. So it wouldn't have worked well
	on a tablet. Sigh.

	I began looking at [https://unity3d.com Unity] as a means of implementing the game,
	which would address the performance problem. In so doing I
	thought about being very fancy and having as a backdrop and
	main screen a scene made up of words moving in 3D. It was at this time
	the name of the game changed to ''Words'' from ''Memoriam''.

	It didn't take long for me to realise [Unity] has a steep
	learning curve, and that [Unity] wasn't going to give the
	sharp precise look I was after. So the latest idea is for
	the main menu and backdrop to be made up of words, but
	words moving in 2D rather than 3D.

	There's an self-referential theme on the main menu, so the word "tiny" is
	in a small point size. "gnu" is a programmer's joke (as well as a name of
	a song by Flanders and Swann). "cyan" is in the colour cyan, as well
	as the name of the company who developed "Myst".

	I hoped to do the animation of the main menu using
	[https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp CSS animations],
	but had to do a lot in Javascript. Either it wasn't possible in
	CSS, or the results were too jerky when I tried.
