I didn't play Go online until 2020, and the start of the Covid pandemic. But deprived of Thursday night Go meetings in Cambridge I have started to play online. Fortunately there are a number of websites around where one can play over the Internet. They work quite well with a little getting used to or setup required.

One has to register on the websites to use them, and if one uses more than one website it's convenient to have a common username. (This I have failed to do because of different restrictions on usernames.)

|Common username restrictions|
|-|
|10 letters|
|Alphabetical characters or digits|

Until one has played enough ranked games on a website one
won't have a grade, and without a grade it can be hard to get
games. I got a grade on [OGS](https://online-go.com/) by
playing the bots (computer Go programs) there. The ranks on
the different websites are not consistent. People have tried
to compare those ranks - see [Rank - worldwide comparison](https://senseis.xmp.net/?RankWorldwideComparison).

There are some good lists of online Go servers on the Internet - for instance
[Sensei'sLibrary](https://senseis.xmp.net/?GoServers) and [American Go Assocation](https://www.usgo.org/go-internet). *Real time* here is playing a game in real time,
*turn based* is more logging in every so often to see if your opponent
has played a move, and being under no time pressure to play your next move.
*Browser*, *Android*, etc
indicate what clients are available to play on the particular server.
