I didn't play Go online until 2020, and the start of the Covid pandemic which stopped the Thursday night Go meetings in Cambridge I used to go to. Fortunately there are a number of websites around where one can play over the Internet, and they work quite well with a little getting used to.

One has to register on the websites to use them, and if one uses more than one website it's convenient to have a common username. (This I have failed to do because of different restrictions on usernames.)

|Common username restrictions|
|-|
|10 letters|
|Alphabetical characters or digits|

Until one has played enough ranked games on a website one
won't have a grade, and without a grade it can be hard to get
games. I got a grade on [OGS](https://online-go.com/) by
playing the bots (computer Go programs) there. The ranks on
the different websites are not consistent. People have tried
to compare those ranks - see [Go rank survey 2018](https://idex.github.io/go-rank-survey/go-survey-results).

There are some good lists of online Go servers on the Internet - for instance
[Sensei'sLibrary](https://senseis.xmp.net/?GoServers) and [American Go Assocation](https://www.usgo.org/go-internet). *Real time* here is playing a game against the clock,
*turn based* is a correspondence game free of the clock. *Browser*, *Android*, etc
indicate what clients are available to play on the particular server.
