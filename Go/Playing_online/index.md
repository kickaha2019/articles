I didn't play Go online until 2020, and the start of the Covid pandemic which stopped the Thursday night Go meetings in Cambridge I used to go to. Fortunately there are a number of websites around where one can play over the Internet, and they work quite well with a little getting used to.

One has to register on the websites to use them, and if one uses more than one website it's convenient to have a common username. (This I have failed to do because of different restrictions on usernames.)
The most restrictive is to limit usernames to 10 characters which must be alphanumeric.

Until one has played enough ranked games on a website one
won't have a grade, and without a grade it can be hard to get
games. I got a grade on [OGS](https://online-go.com/) by
playing the bots (computer Go programs) there. The ranks on
the different websites are not consistent. People have tried
to compare those ranks - see [Go rank survey 2018](https://idex.github.io/go-rank-survey/go-survey-results).

There are some good lists of online Go servers on the Internet - for instance
[Sensei'sLibrary](https://senseis.xmp.net/?GoServers) and [American Go Assocation](https://www.usgo.org/go-internet). 
In the tables of servers on this site *Real time* here is playing a game against the clock,
*turn based* is a correspondence game free of the clock. *Browser*, *Android*, etc
indicate what clients are available to play on the particular server.
