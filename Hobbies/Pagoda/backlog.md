This is a list of possible changes to *Pagoda* which I'm
putting online in the hope of getting comments from people.
If you do have comments please [contact](contact) me.  I'd
appreciate hearing from you.

*Idea 1*: Change the background and colours on the Pagoda
site.  One complaint I've had is that the background is too
dominant.

*Idea 2*: List foreign games which haven't been released in
English.  So far I've never done this.

*Idea 3*: List links from more websites.  Suggestions
as to which websites welcome.

*Idea 4*: Catalog games as either Adventure or Casual type and
allow filtering of the games listed by type.

*Idea 5*: Remove the attempt to classify games as indie or
slideshow or to give platforms etc.  This information at
best is  incomplete and at worst misleading.
