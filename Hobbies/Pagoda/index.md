[Pagoda](http://www.pagodagamedatabase.com) is an online database
of links relating to Adventure games that I've created and
maintain.  The initial reason I did was I wanted to find where
I could buy a given Adventure game, but [Pagoda](http://www.pagodagamedatabase.com) now has a life
of its own.  I'm encouraged to continue by occasionally hearing
of people using [Pagoda](http://www.pagodagamedatabase.com) to find information about games.

Please see *Backlog* where I list possible changes to [Pagoda](http://www.pagodagamedatabase.com)
and ask for feedback.

I've tried several times to classify the games listed in [Pagoda](http://www.pagodagamedatabase.com)
but each time found the exercise problematic.  A number of
websites have their own schemes of classification and good for them.
Recently I've added into [Pagoda](http://www.pagodagamedatabase.com) the concept of a group of
games which is at least a better defined concept.  From a lot of
reviews it's hard to glean what a game is like.  For instance
some reviewers won't mention if a game has arcade sequences.

[Pagoda](http://www.pagodagamedatabase.com) is maintained by scanning a number of websites for links
to reviews and walkthroughs etc, then matching those links to
games already in the database.  New games are added as found.

Challenges are variant names for games (for example "Atlantis 2"
being also known as "Beyond Atlantis").  And when websites decide
to restructure themselves which they're at perfect liberty to
do, it just causes me to have to redo that part of my database.
