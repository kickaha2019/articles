@title		Responsive layout

Pure CSS is used to vary the look of the generated webpages
according to the screen acreage available. What is varied is
the size of text and certain divs, the size of images used, and
the logo used at the top of the webpage.

As of the time of writing the sizes used are:

|Screen width|Font size|Icon dimension|Image dimension|
|-|-|-|-|
|360|14px|96x72|360x270|
|768|18px|96x72|758x561|
|1280|18px|128x96|758x561|
|1920|22px|128x96|1024x768|

I could have tried using something like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
to make the website responsive. I didn't want that much cleverness. My
website is aimed to be low maintenance and simple. I prefer using as
little technology as possible, using as few features to accomplish
goals. The more features the more complicated a program is to
maintain and understand, and the more vulnerable one is to changes.
