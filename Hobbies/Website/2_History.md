I have spent numerous hours tinkering with my personal website,
perhaps more on the way it is defined and generated than on the
actual content!

|Date|Page source|Comments|

|2000|Text files|PHP got used rather than HTML
|2008|[Apple](Apple)'s *iWeb*|Didn't support a complex site
|2009|[Filemaker](https://www.filemaker.com/)'s *Bento*|It seemed like a good idea at the time
|2010|[Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/)|Too complicated for me
|2011|[Apple](Apple)'s *iWeb* again|Apple killed *iWeb* anyway
|2013|Text files again|Worked well but limited styling of text
|2020|Markdown|More styling possibilities

I prefer static generation rather than using something dynamic like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
or [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) or [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/)? Those are good tools for
the right website, but the static approach reduces worries about keeping
one's website secure, about having to apply updates to the software
running the website. The static approach is likely to be faster, less
demanding on the web server, but that hasn't been a concern to me at
least.

Having the website defined as data files on one's local machine
rather in MySQL database tables is a lot easier to backup, and also
less at risk at being locked into one particular technology. So something like [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)
would make me uneasy about having a website on it.

I can edit the website from the comfort of my
[iPad](https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad/) while I'm
lapsitting a cat.  The website can be re-structured by
moving and renaming files and directories around.  The text files
have a simplistic format so I can just type away, and most of the
text is content.

So why not use one of the established static website generators
like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)?
Those are also good tools for the right website, with plenty of
functionality. One answer is computing is a hobby of mine, and
implementing a website generator is fun in its way to me. None of
the static website generators give quite what I'm after, and while
they might be customised to do so in terms of plugins and templates
the learning curve looks as steep as writing one's own simple
generator.

Another answer is that these tools to me are about flexibility and
configurability. I wanted something which was deliberately limited
and constraining, which would dissuade me from being too clever.
So an analogy might be I'd take an automatic car over one with
a manual gearbox, being able to choose which gear I'm in doesn't
interest me so much as getting from A to B.

There is the minor question of whether anyone else reads the
pages on my website, or whether it's like all the blogs out
there with zero comments.  When I've blundered (like failing
to replace the default text on iWeb pages, or got the
formatting wrong) I take some comfort in thinking no-one may
have seen my misdeed.  But it's rare for people to report mistakes
on websites, they normally just move on.
