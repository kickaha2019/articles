Some people host their website from their own computers, me I rely on
shared hosting to host mine. I've moved around different hosting
companies a little, more down to technical issues than price.

The latest hosting company I'm on ([Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/shared/)) have plenty of
features for me. SSH supported, free SSL, SSD drives to speed things
up. Support ticket system could be better but with patience OK.
PHP 7 broke my website but that's not their fault.
