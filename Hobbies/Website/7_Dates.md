How to order the children or siblings listed on each webpage?

By default they are listed in lexicographical order of their filenames. There
are two ways of affecting this ordering.

An explicit ordering can be forced by putting a number on the front of
the filename (or title if title is overriden). For example you should
see the webpage address for this webpage has a **7_** on the front of
it forcing this webpage to be the 7th.

If the webpages aren't numbered like that then another ordering can be
imposed by giving a date to the webpages. This is particularly aimed at
the diary entries to force them to be sorted in date order (which makes
a kind of sense). If a date is specified it will appear at the top of
the webpage.

So for example the [Florida 2001](2001/Florida) page has metadata including:

~~~
---
title: Florida
date: Sunday, 24 June 2001
~~~

specifying its date as **24th June 2001**.
