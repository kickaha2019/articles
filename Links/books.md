[Brandon Sanderson](https://brandonsanderson.com) is a writer
I may be getting into. He's inventive with building systems
of magic for his fantasies.

[Garth Nix](http://www.garthnix.com) has written young adult
fiction like the [Abhorsen](http://oldkingdom.com.au/) books.

[The Misenchanted Page](http://www.watt-evans.com/) is a website
of one of my favourite SF authors Lawrence Watt-Evans.
