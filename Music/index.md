Music speaks deeply because it doesn't use words. I listen to music in the
car, and at work mostly nowadays. Virginia and I go to the occasional concert.

Classical music wise I like Bach, Debussy, Ravel, Bartok, Satie to start with.

Progressive rock wise I like [ELP](http://www.emersonlakepalmer.com/),
[King Crimson](https://www.dgmlive.com/), [Gentle Giant](https://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Gentle_Giant_Home_Page),
and further out [Einst&uuml;rzende Neubaten](https://neubauten.org/).

J-POP wise I listen to [Perfume](http://www.perfume-web.jp/) and
[BabyMetal](https://www.babymetal.com/en/).

Christian music wise I listen to [Matt Redman](http://mattredman.com/),
[Sixteen Cities](https://www.revenantworship.com),
[Laura Story](https://laurastorymusic.com/),
YFriday, [Phatfish](http://www.phatfish.net/).
