	Music speaks deeply because it doesn't use words. I listen to music in the
	car, and at work mostly nowadays. Virginia and I go to the occasional concert.

	Classical music wise I like Bach, Debussy, Ravel, Bartok, Satie to start with.

	Progressive rock wise I like [http://www.emersonlakepalmer.com/ ELP],
	[https://www.dgmlive.com/ King Crimson], [https://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Gentle_Giant_Home_Page Gentle Giant],
	and further out [https://neubauten.org/ Einst&uuml;rzende Neubaten].

	J-POP wise I listen to [http://www.perfume-web.jp/ Perfume] and
  [https://www.babymetal.com/en/ BabyMetal].
