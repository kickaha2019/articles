Title:
  The soft toys

Text:
  I keep forgetting their names so here is a page about the soft toys that
  Virginia and I have, and a short biography for each. The soft toys are
  part of our household, taking part in [../Diary/2005/christmas/index.html Christmas] and
  starring in [../Games/my_games/Card2013/index.html one] of my gamelets.

  2011. After she died in 2012 we gave Beatrice a home. As Beatrice is dressed
  for sea voyages we have taken her with us on later cruises.

Text:
  Decades ago Virginia's mother worked at the Central News Agency department store
  in Durban South
  Africa. One Christmas promotion involved the Bentley bears, available for a lot less
  if you spent a certain amount. Virginia's mother levered this promotion to
  give her daughters each a bear. Hamilton
  was originally called Bentley but that name wasn't really suitable. So Hamilton
  he became. Hamilton has been through the washing machine once because he got dirty,
  and still suffers trauma as a result.

  Virginia used to work at Careforce in Waterbeach. People used to come round
  Careforce regulary trying to sell books. One time not only was it books on
  offer but also large soft toy tigers. So Sebastian joined the household.
  He reminds me of a [../Diary/2005/triumph/index.html jigsaw] Virginia did.
