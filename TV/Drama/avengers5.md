Each episode is very formulaic, there's a mysterious series of murders which
John Steed and Emma Peel are called on to investigate. Everything gets wrapped
up with a neat comment at the end, and order is restored. What lifts the **Avengers**
out of the norm is firstly the quixotic (or lunatic) people and situations that the
Steed / Peel duo encounter. Talented actors from the 1960s were given
space in these episodes to overact. So in these episodes you will find Christopher
Lee and Peter Cushing and Jon Pertwee to name but three.

There is the chemistry between Steed and Peel, the banter between them. To some
extent this is TV of its period, Emma Peel isn't a helpless female (her martial
arts skills are debatable) but she does end up tied up in predicaments needing Steed to rescue
her rather often.

The visual style (particularly Diana Rigg's outfits) reflect the swinging sixties. It is
all striking colours and brave designs, not grunge.

The Russians (played largely as buffoons) serve as opponents in many of the episodes
reflecting the cold war times.
