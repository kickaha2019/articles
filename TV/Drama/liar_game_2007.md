Based on a Japanese manga about a naive college student who gets enmeshed
into a mysterious game where the players lie and cheat each other for
large sums of money. Compared with the Korean remake this version is more
mythic and archetypal, a battle between good and evil, a battle between
trust and distrust. The acting may be over-acting but it fits the
production, the melodrama.

The series wins on a number of levels. There is the swindling and lying and
cheating and gambling itself, with the arrogant hero saving the
heroine perpetually in peril. There is an open subtext about trust, the
risks of trusting, and what distrust and disbelief do. The visual
impact (perhaps from the manga itself?) is high.

The weak point is episodes 9 and 10 which recap a lot of the previous
material while giving the background to the Liar Game.

Overall I loved this!
