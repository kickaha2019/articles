A sequel series to the original *Liar Game* which is more of the
same fun. Our innocent college student played by Toda Erika gets
to be a little more intelligent but mostly it's Matsuda Shota's
suave swindler getting our heroine out of trouble.

The series is also setting the stage for the movie with the
final stage and game.
