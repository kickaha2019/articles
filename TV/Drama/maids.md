The heroine starts off as a privileged nobleman's daughter in Joseon
Korea, but falls through the bottom of society into slavery when her
father is wrongly executed for treason. She undergoes hardships, some
cheerfully inflicted by those she offended while an insensitive noble lady.
So she's not perfect. But
through these hardships she becomes a better strong nobler person.
So she isn't a helpless damsel waiting for a prince.
The plot involves the lost son of a king, a secret society seeking to
restore the Koryeo dynasty, ambitious ruthless ministers.

This is high melodrama, a lot of cultivated meanness, a nobly suffering
persisting heroine, lovely period dresses, some great believable
performances particularly by the lead actress who carries the whole drama.
A lot of Korean TV dramas rely on having celebrities in the main roles
who cannot act. There is also more structure more shape to this drama,
and characters who change as they go through their stories.

The drama starts with a powerful flashforward which jumps back to the
heroine washing her face before her fall, linked by a water theme which recurs at
various points. Another important theme is what the heroine walks in and
on, which symbolises the stages in her story arc as she falls and adjusts
to having fallen. Her changing costume reflects her declared status in
society, she notably copes with her changing status better than
those around her who can't let go of what she was.

The writing is critical of the slave system in Joseon Korea, of the
way the aristocrats lorded it over the dehumanised at the bottom of the
system who were trapped there.  I suspect at the time itself
even the slaves in a way supported the awful system, for instance the
heroine's maid is slavishly loyal to her mistress. The writing
and direction manage to avoid this being a run of the mill drama.

So for me a wonderful drama. Intelligent writing. Lovely meanness.
