"Secret Love"
is a highly melodramatic tale of love and revenge.  Just as
a budding lawyer makes the big time he kills a woman after
drinking and driving.  His fiancee takes the rap so he go
on and be a success.  Unhappily the spoilt rich brat whose
girlfriend got run down makes life hell for the poor noble
fiancee who has a lot of crying and suffering to do.

The literal title is "Secret" and several characters in this
drama have secrets which they suffer under.  The strength of
the drama is how it all flows from a single point, seemingly
naturally yet unexpectedly as well.

Corruption works its way through the people in the story.
The lawyer is all too human and flawed despite his heroic
goals, and falls like someone in a Greek tragedy.
That the rich can buy justice
is taken for granted.  The rich brat is only redeemed by his love
for a good woman.

Some great moments when the characters and film almost stop
and we see a tableaux vivant.  The heroine suffers nobly.
The bad guy is torn by inner demons.  Quite watchable.
