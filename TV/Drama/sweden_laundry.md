The put-upon middle child of a family gets given a supernatural power by her dead grandmother.
The power to tell from people's clothes what they're worried about. The downside is
she has to help them. This quirky comedy of manners manages to be fresh, helped by
its starting premise being so original. It's not dramatic, but there are a host of
interesting characters and twists and turns. A cat also pops up here and there.

Watching this gets a sense of modern Korea, the way people are - that's the way it
feels to me. So it's country which is very technological yet people still consult
psychics. Parents seek to live through their children.

A slight shame that the heroine doesn't tie the knot by the end of the drama, but it's
a rewarding watch.
