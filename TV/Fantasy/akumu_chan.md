A cold-hearted school teacher finds herself enmeshed with a strange new
pupil who has fantastical prophetic dreams. Try as she may to avoid it
her life is turned upside down and inside out.

At one level each episode is the pupil Yuiko Koto has a weird dream, and
the teacher Ayami Mutoi does her best to avoid that dream coming true. On that
level the drama is quite acceptable and involving and interesting,
adding a twist to the usual formula.

Where the drama shines is the character arcs, particularly the teacher
strongly played by Keiko Kitagawa. That holds the whole drama together
and lifts it to greatness. The characters grow through the episodes.

Wonderful and fun.
