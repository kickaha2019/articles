 Blazing transfer students

Text:
	Totally nuts TV series based on a Japanese anime about the Blazing
	Transfer Students who go to problem schools and sort them out - sort
	of. Self-referential to absurdity and beyond, aware it is anime
	and no more, tripping lightly from trope to trope. 

	For lovers of the bizarre and weird.
