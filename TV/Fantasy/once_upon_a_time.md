A grand collision of a load of fairy tales with an adult context.
The plot has an evil queen enacting a curse which sends all
the fairy-tale characters to our world, robbing them of their
memories - and their happy endings.

A large number of inter-twining storylines with larger than
life characters. A complex back story revealed gradually as
the episodes progress. Good production values and a wide
range of locations. A great performance by Robert Carlyle as
Mr Gold / Rumplestiltskin.

Very palatable entertainment. I'm not sure how many series
I will watch, before it gets samey. Or before it all gets
too random. But the first series is an achievement.
