A totally adorable stop motion animation series starring perpetual
loser Kaoru and the soft toys (Rilakkuma Korilakkuma and Kiiroitori)
who live with her. See it or lose a magical experience!

The soft toys (two bears and one bird) are Sanrio toys. There's a store
at [Rilakkuma World](https://rilakkumaworld.com/). The thirteen episodes
are short, whimsical, poignant, profound.
