A six part series about poor Pan Li Lan who becomes enmeshed
with the dead son of a rich family in 1890s Malacca. This dead son Lim Tian Ching from
a Chinese Buddhist netherworld interferes in the world of the living, and
coerces Pan Li Lan to investigate his murder. She eventually finds herself
in the netherworld too, forced to be a ghost bride. Will she able to return
to the land of the living?

The setting is very much traditional Chinese beliefs, where mediums can
contact the spirit world, where good people get reincarnated and the bad
people get judged, where being filial is very important.
It is well produced and acted, the relatively short length
for a TV drama helps maintain the tension. The costumes are rich,
particularly in the netherworld segments. The ending may be a little
anachronistic, but acceptable.

Very watchable, and keeps moving.
