The start of the tragic history of the Baudelaire children, orphaned
by a fire and then persecuted by the unscrupulous wicked Count Olaf.

Delicious black comedy, weird situations, outlandish characters,
a deadpan narrator who constantly advises aganst watching this
tale of woe. A unique experience. This TV series has the
advantage of the active participation of the source books'
author Lemony Snicket (real name Daniel
Handler).

A well produced Netflix series which creates a fantasy world
in some ways Victorian in feel, but yet modern.
