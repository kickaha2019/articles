 A Series of Unfortunate Events
	
Text:
	The start of the tragic history of the Baudelaire children, orphaned
	by a fire and then persecuted by the unscrupulous wicked Count Olaf.

	Delicious black comedy, weird situations, outlandish characters,
	a deadpan narrator who constantly advises aganst watching this
	tale of woe. A unique experience. This TV series has the
	advantage of the active participation of the source books'
	author Lemony Snicket (real name Daniel
	Handler).

	A well produced Netflix series which creates a fantasy world
	in some ways Victorian in feel, but yet modern.
