The setting for **Death in Paradise** is lovely, the sun battered beaches
of the Carribean, topical rainforests, a different background.
The chemistry of the cast (in the first seasons at least) worked
very well, a nice mix of personalities with their differences.

Each episode features a murder (or two or more) which the Saint Marie
police force have to solve. There's enough suspects to make it
interesting, and often the mysteries have a classic whodunit feel
to them.  A pleasant evening's watch.
