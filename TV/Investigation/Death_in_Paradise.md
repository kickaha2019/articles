The setting for **Death in Paradise** is lovely, the sun battered beaches
of the Carribean, topical rainforests, a different background.
The chemistry of the cast (in the first seasons at least) worked
very well, a nice mix of personalities with their differences.

Each episode features a murder (or two or more) which the Saint Marie
police force have to solve. There's enough suspects to make it
interesting, and often the mysteries have a classic whodunit feel
to them.  So the episodes finish with a Poirot style reveal to
those involved in the case. There often isn't enough evidence
to really convict the murderer(s), particularly if they stay
silent. There are locked room mysteries where
murderers achieve the impossible. Time and truth cannot be
relied on.

A pleasant evening's watch.
