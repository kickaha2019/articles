See this for the great chemisty between MacNee and Rigg as a duo who
investigate impossible happenings, and also for the parade of guest stars
drawn from the cream of British character actors at the time.

Each episode follows an almost set formula. Usually a few gents get
themselves bumped off in a mysterious fashion. Steed and Mrs Peel
roam around baffled for a time. The bad guys do some more bad
things. Mrs Peel ends up in a sticky situation. Steed steps in at
the last moment. But within these formulaic episodes there is a
lot of imagination at work, oddball characters, and endearing
banter. And cool style.

Horrifying to think this is already half a century old!
