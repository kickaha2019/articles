One synopsis on offer is "People lose loved ones in crimes and the criminals are not punished. The daily lives of these people are completely broken. They form a group to realize justice."
Or young kid traumatised by miscarriage of justice grows up to seek revenge
on the corrupt prosecutor responsible. He enlists or manipulates other victims to help.

Bowls along at a good pace. Villains to boo at. Plenty of traumatic experiences
and traumatised people. Cast which worked well together. Did not get stuck in
a rut but gave an unfolding story. Fun!
