A naive nice optimistic chaebol heiress ends up in the body of
a suicidal woman who's lost hope after losing her adored.
Our heiress has to deal not only with only having 49 days to return to her own
body, but also dealing with her fiancee who is actually trying to destroy
her and her father's business.

Well paced drama which feels like it has an over-arching storyline
and not just padded out with episodes. The characters evolve and
change during the serial. The last episode has some twists in it
which may come as a surprise.

It has to be said that this drama chooses to have its cake and
eat it. As it is light hearted I didn't mind, but
for the sake of the drama things happen which feel like the
script writers have forced in.

Great fun, I'll be re-watching this one. A drama which for me
just works.
