A teacher is engaged to be married to a doctor who caused her to
have an accident when she tried to retrieve a bouquet of flowers
delivered to the wrong bride.  An accident causes a student's soul
to end up in the doctor's body.  The teacher has to contend with
no-one else understanding the situation and the complications that
ensure.

A good farce with likeable characters, Bae Suzy (a singer turned actress)
plays a forceful character inn love with the student. The ending
is a little brief, not everyone liked or understood it. It's a
little open to interpretation. There are some familar faces
in this Hong Sisters drama like Ahn Seok-Hwan.

More than other Hong Sisters dramas "Big" is driven by the story
within the story, contained in a book "Miracle" which features
prominently.  This both explains the story behind the story,
and also presages the story being told.

There are some great scenes in "Big" (I particularly liked the school
assemblies in the open air), and some wistful scenes involving
minor characters like the uncle and school principal.
