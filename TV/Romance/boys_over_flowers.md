A Korean TV drama based on a Japanese manga "Hana yori Dango", whose
title (literally Boys over Flowers) is a pun on a Japanese saying of
"dumplings over flowers" meaning people who attend a flower festival Hanami
but only go for food rather than appreciate the flora.

The plot is nice and simple - poor girl Geum Jandi who has a heart of
gold finds herself at a school for the mega-rich where she runs
up against the elite F4 gang of four. Cue some noble suffering,
rich snob falling in love despite himself, misunderstandings,
machinations of mother
who only wants the best as a daughter-in-law.

As an example of the genre it's very watchable. There's lots of eye candy
locations, emotional baggage to work through, sub-plots. The
men in the drama are very flawed, the women in a way drive the drama
along. The leads don't have to be great actors as their roles call for
naivety. It all ends happily, pleasing Jandi's best friend.
