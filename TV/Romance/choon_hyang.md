This drama also gets called "My Delightful Girl Choon Hyang".  It's an
adaptation of a classical Korean drama about a girl Choon Hyang born
into slavery who despite the odds, and a corrupt official trying to
force her into being his mistress, ends up the wife of a police
inspector.  As such Choon Hyang is an archetype of hope, showing that
from humble beginnings if you're good hearted and work hard you can
go up in the world.

The drama makes explicit allusions to the classical legend by parodying
or deconstructing it in opening or closing scenes with the actors in period dress.
This is very funny, but tends to undermine how seriously one can take the
drama as a whole.

"Sassy Girl Chun-hyang" starts as light comedy with the two leads being forced
into a fake marriage while at school in Namwon province.  The action then moves to
Seoul where towards the end we veer into melodrama as the bad guy
decides to get the girl by fair or by foul means. Whether this is
any social comment in this is up to the viewer. It bumbles along happily.
