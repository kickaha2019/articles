"The Greatest Love"
is a TV mini-series written by the Hong sisters, perhaps their best.
It's about the tangled romantic relationships between an arrogant self-centred
superstar, a washed-up girl idol with a heart of gold, a successful
manipulative girl idol, and a doctor naive of the entertainment
industry.  On one sense the series writes itself, no bets on who ends
up with whom.

*The Greatest Love* is a mixture of romance, farce, and social comment.
There are some strong romantic moments, particularly effective is the end of
the last but one episode, where it all comes together for the heroine.  There
are some fine scenes of farce and comic misunderstandings, which Kong Hyo-Jin as the
eccentric heroine plays to the hilt.  Worth watching just for that.

*The Greatest Love* is set in the Korean entertainment industry, and portrays
that as an artificial construction of artificialities.  Image is everything,
not reality, as exemplified by two of the leads having a sham relationship just
for the benefit of contracts.  Perhaps the series says it's really what in the
heart that matters, and the hero does have a change of heart in more ways than
one.

*The Greatest Love* also features the Internet, and how extreme opinions
are fostered by that superficial medium.  How apparently meek and caring
individuals will express cruel hateful words in the electronic world.  How
such unimportant utterances can have great effects.
