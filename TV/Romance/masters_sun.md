"The Master's Sun"
is a TV mini-series written by the Hong sisters who have written
a number of successful such mini-series.  It starts Kong Hyo-jin as
a woman troubled by her ability to see ghosts.  By chance she
finds touching the CEO of a giant mall frees her temporarily
from her occult affliction.  Step by misstep she and the CEO
begin to relate to each other.

This is a romance - by the end all has been resolved much as in
one of Shakespeare's lighter works.  It is perhaps darker than other
mini-series by the Hong sisters, but not that dark.  Comedy
wins out over melodrama, and there are some genuinely funny
moments.  It has appeal even to Westerners, in fact I think
it could be remade with changes as a Western TV mini-series.

The CEO (So Ji Sub) is an entertaining character, especially
when he's being mean and insensitive.  There is some sharp
dialogue in here, and emotionally charged scenes.  The romance
swings between extremes, and is only balanced in the final
episode.  There is also some depth here, real people behaving
in real ways.
