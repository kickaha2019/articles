F-grade naive school-girl Kotoko gets a crush on the school's star
student Naoki, but her wishful approach to him gets a crushing snubbing.
However a stray meteorite flattens Kotoko's house, and she and her
father are put up by a friend of her father who also turns out to
be Naoki's father. Kotoko's fragile affection for Naoki, and Naoki's
mother's fondness for Kotoko, bring Kotoko and Naoki closer.

This is one adaptation of the original manga, I haven't seen the
others, but this one benefits from the lead actress being the right
age. Her over the top reactions, and her attempts to compete with
the more mature rivals, are very funny.
