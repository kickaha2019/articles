Plot: read the Jane Austen book.

The Jane Austen book is a romance between
initially prejudiced Lizzie, and proud aristocratic
Darcy, but that is almost a side effect.  The book is
gripping both as a commentary on Jane Austen's time
(now so far from us,) and also on human nature itself
which is timeless.  This BBC production gives enough
time to develop the minor characters so we can see
into Austen's world, and revel in her often
ascerbic wit.
