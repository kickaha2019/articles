Plot: the Doctor finds himself trapped in an
inter-galactic peepshow, where different life-forms
are unwittingly caged in small worldlets.  He has to
save himself and the other prisoners as the peepshow
machine disintegrates.

A neat mix of suspense, comedy (particularly the
carnival characters), imaginative story-line and the
social comment prevalent in the Jon Pertwee years.
Perhaps some of the special effects are tacky . . .
but this is classic fun.
