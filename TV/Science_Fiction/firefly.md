A fusion between the mythic Wild West and a high tech
future where man has left an exhausted Earth and colonised
other worlds. A shamefully cancelled series.

Mal Reynolds, on the losing side on a failed war of
independence, makes a living running errands in a space
transport.  Errands like transporting cattle.  He gets
caught up in the sinister activities of the Blue Corporation
when he takes on board a pair of refugees from the
Alliance, one of whom is the disturbed telepath River,
victim of experiments.

Very strong group of characters with great interplay and
promising story arcs.  A shame their stories were not
fully told.  The setting of "Firefly" is an intoxicating
blend of American and Chinese, of rich affluent society
with space age gizmos against poor farmers scratching a
living from the soil as they might have done in "Shane".
