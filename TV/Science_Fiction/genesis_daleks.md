Plot: the Time Lords send the Doctor back in
time to Skaro to stop the Daleks being created,
fearing they will come to dominate the universe.

Ironic if Tom Baker didn't like the Daleks that he
acted in this, for me the best Dalek story in fact the
best Dr Who story.  A story which takes itself
seriously from the Doctor agonising over whether it's
right to destroy the Daleks, to the chilling moment
as the Daleks turn on their creator Davros.  The
warped scientist Davros was so memorable that he
was resurrected for another four stories.
