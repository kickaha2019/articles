Plot: the Doctor is trapped in the land of fiction
and must contend in a place where reality is very
mutable.

Patrick Troughton, Wendy Padbury, and Fraser Hines
had established a great working relationship by this
time and it shows.  This story experiments with
plot in a fascinating fashion, to an extent never
done since.  Zoe on the Tardis console is an iconic
scene.
