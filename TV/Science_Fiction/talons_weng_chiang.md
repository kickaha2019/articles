Doctor|Tom Baker

Year|1977
Cast|Tom Baker, Louise Jameson, John Bennett
Length|6 25 minute episodes

Plot: in Victorian London a Chinese magician has
something nasty hidden in the cellar.

Clever writing combining many genres, from Hammer
horror to "My Fair Lady".  A high-class
period serial with some great character acting.  I
regret the Doctor always knowing so much (so he knows
all about the villain.)
