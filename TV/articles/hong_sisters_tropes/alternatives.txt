Title:
	Alternatives to reality

Text:
	A sequence or sequences presenting what might have happened, or what might happen
	in the future. An interlude sequence representing the daydream of a character.

	It's difficult in a visual medium to relate what a character is thinking, unlike
	a book. Good acting can indicate mood, but a character soliloquising to tell
	the audience what's on their mind is tedious and not so watchable.
	So an insert sequence can convey where a character is in an amusing and
	visibly interesting way.

	Sequences showing what characters think might happen can prepare the
	audience for future developments, can make them uncertain as to how the
	story is going to unfold, can construct expectations which the drama will
	later confound.

	The downside of these interpolated sequences is that they interrupt
	to some extent the immersion of the audience in the drama. They
	interrupt the flow of events. The sequences are
	like the sequences you might get in a variety show.
