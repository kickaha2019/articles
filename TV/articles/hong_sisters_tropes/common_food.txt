Title:
	Who wants gourmet food

Text:
	One or more characters can have a taste for simpler food like ramen rather
	than posh gourmet dishes. This can serve as a bond between characters, or as
	establishing a character as having an aspect which is down to earth or
	ordinary. Acquiring said simpler food can be involved, or the preparation
	of it requires knowledge transfer.

	Characters need to talk to convey to the viewer what the drama wants them
	to know. Talking heads in themselves tend to be boring, but if characters
	talk in the context of a meal then that gives something to occupy the eyes
	while the ears are occupied too.
