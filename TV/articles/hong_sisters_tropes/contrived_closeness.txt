Title:
	A closeness contrived

Text:
	The first kiss, or first embrace, or first sharing the same
	sleeping space, is often very contrived - and not consensual on
	one (or both) sides. In a romantic drama love at first sight rather
	spoils the fun, and no-one would watch a couple without major
	obstacles on their way to their eventual union.  In fact there's more
	delight watching a couple being together forced by circumstance as
	Shakespeare knew: so Hero and Claudio are a boring couple in
	''All's Well That Ends Well'', Beatrice and Benedick are the stars.

	However some of the kisses or closenesses are so contrived that
	there seems to be a sub-text:
	love comes after one's in a relationship, not before it.
