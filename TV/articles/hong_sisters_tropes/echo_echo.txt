Title:
	Action replays

Text:
	A sequence where the same action is repeated, usually by a different
	character. This may not advance the drama much in the direction
	of the plot, but done right is a pleasing conceit. Repeated actions
	can serve to tie the multiple episodes together, to remind the
	viewers of previous episodes.

	(I don't know from just watching a TV drama whether a particular
	element was written by the writers, was adlibbed by an actor,
	or was directed by director. A repeated action could be more a
	directorial ornamentation than a scripted element of the drama.)
