Title:
	Stand not on one's own two feet

Text:
	A character has an injury to the foot or ankle, or loses a shoe, or otherwise
	is unable to walk properly. This can create a useful dramatic need for closeness
	between two characters, perhaps mean the hero and heroine are seen together in
	the same car creating misunderstandings. The physical contact necessary for
	bandaging an ankle can hint towards more intimate physical contact later.
