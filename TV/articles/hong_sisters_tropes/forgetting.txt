Title:
	The forgetting

Text:
	Nothing like a healthy dose of amnesia. The hero and heroine are
	getting along swimmingly until one of them forgets they're in love
	with the other. A useful worry to introduce into the storyline,
	into the will "they won't they" concern which keep the interest up
	until the last episode.
