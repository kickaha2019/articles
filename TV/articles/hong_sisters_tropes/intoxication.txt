Title:
	The hero or heroine intoxicated

Text:
	It's very useful in a drama to have the hero (or
	more often the heroine) intoxicated.  It provides
	the rationale for them to act out of character for
	comic effect. Or the rationale for them to be
	unconscious and so not doing what they might otherwise
	be doing. But above all the rationale for them
	to get into situations they wouldn't otherwise get
	into.

	There's much more dramatic potential in characters
	when they're out of their comfort zone,
	when they're out of their normality.
