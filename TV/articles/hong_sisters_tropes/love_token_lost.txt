Title:
	Love's token lost

Text:
	Solid objects like rings can be representations of
	the emotions and feelings inside our hearts. In a drama
	such embodiments of love are a very useful visual expression of
	positions on the romantic battlefield. They can
	also not only just be markers, but have a role of their own.

	So we can have X giving Y a token
	of affection. Y, despite knowing they must hang
	onto it, loses said token. Or perhaps X tosses the
	token away, saying our affection is now lost.
	Y may then indulge in
	a desperate hunt for the token, perhaps involving water.
	Z may then make a copy of the token, further
	confusing matters.
