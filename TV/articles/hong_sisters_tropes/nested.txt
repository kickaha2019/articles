Title:
	Story within the story

Text:
	A drama is already a story within a story. From the stories of
	our real lives we nest in and out of the story on the small screen.
	As such it feels right that the drama itself should contain other
	stories being told.

	The story within a story can create expectations of how the
	drama will end which can be frustrated for emotional impact.
	The story within a story can also prepare the audience for the
	way the outer story will end, can justify the way the drama is
	brought to closure. This is the case with "Big", where the
	story within the story plays a central role.

	The Hong Sisters also use the story within a story as a
	prop of the drama in its own right, not just as a fiction
	inside a fiction. Structurally this is very interesting.
