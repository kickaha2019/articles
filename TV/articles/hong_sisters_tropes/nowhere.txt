Title:
	A night in the middle of nowhere

Text:
	The lead characters get stranded for a night in an out of the way
	place, miles from anyway, no modern facilities, no mobile
	reception. A great place for a long talk about deep matters
	which wouldn't get discussed in a busy city where there's so
	much to do. If the drama needs a long talk about deep matters.
	Or a good place to move a relationship along. Or some comedy
	with figures from a rural past.

	The middle of nowhere may be a reminder of how things used to,
	perhaps how inconvenient it was. Or how people were friendlier
	in the old days.

	Every drama should have a middle of nowhere moment.
