Text:
	A sequence parodying perhaps another film, or a sporting event, or
	a book. Such sequences provide a good change of mood to add variety
	to the drama, they add dashes of humour into what might otherwise
	be sombre and flat.

	Such sequences may also hark back to when the Hong Sisters were
	writers on a variety show.
