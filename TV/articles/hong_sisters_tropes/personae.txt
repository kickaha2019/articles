Title:
	A plurality of personae

Text:
	Viola in "Twelfth Night" is one of Shakespeare's memorable
	characters, around whom much of the play pivots because she
	is a girl pretending to be a boy. Such a situation is rich for
	farce and tension and irony, as characters seek to achieve the
	impossible of being two different people at the same time.

	Well after Shakespeare characters trying to present different
	personae to different people remains a staple feature of dramas,
	particularly comedies. Dramas need characters under stress,
	characters with problems.
