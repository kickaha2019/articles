Title:
	Traumatic experiences required

Text:
	It's not good for a hero to be too strong, and all conquering. He should
	have a traumatic experience somewhere, which leaves him with a major
	disability. Something for the heroine to help him with, or useful for
	the hero to complain that others have forgotten his agony.
