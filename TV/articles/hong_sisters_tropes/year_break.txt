Title:
	Fast forward a year or so

Text:
	It's good to have sudden fast forwards in time. Characters who were
	getting along well may need new problems to occupy the drama. Perhaps
	the year will let a new situation build up which can fill an episode or
	two. If you need a character to be lost then better they're away for
	a decent length of time, more believable.
