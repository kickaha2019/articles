 Kill Me, Heal Me

Text:
	The son of a powerful rich family has split personalities as the result of
	a traumatic childhood. He gets help from an intern psychriatist, but she
	comes to be more than a secret doctor.

	The mystery, and the echoes of the past resonating in the present, work
	surprisingly well for most of the serial. Yes I felt the characters were
	rather dumb not to work the mystery out earlier, it could have been more
	complicated. The beginning is stronger than the end, but most TV serials
	are like that. There's quite a lot of comedy, and also effective
	melodramatic scenes. The soundtrack is very good, great at creating
	moods and enhancing the watching experience. Ji Sung does well to
	portray the seven personalities, he must have had fun doing this serial.

	Fun.
