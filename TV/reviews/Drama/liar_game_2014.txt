Text:
	Based on a Japanese manga about a naive college student who gets enmeshed
	into a mysterious game where the players lie and cheat each other for
	large sums of money. This manga had already been realised as Japanese TV
	dramas and movies.

	The Korean drama keeps the structure, but significantly modifies the
	settings and the background. The "Liar Game" becomes a TV reality show
	rather than a secret underground happening. The heroine's guardian angel
	is not an invincible swinder but a flawed ex-college professor. Secrets
	in the past link the main characters, driving them towards the final
	showdown.

	The small number of episodes (12 rather than 16 or 20 or more) keep the drama
	tight and focussed and strong to the end. Many dramas start well but then just
	become repetitive. The source manga provides a great series of surreal plot events,
	out of the normal grind. The extra writing in the Korean version really
	adds depth to the whole.

	The heroine develops to be more than just someone to be rescued, her naivety
	becomes a strength and something that changes others. The hero too goes
	through a journey as he rediscovers trust to some extent.

	A gem.
