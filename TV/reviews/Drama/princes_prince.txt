	This is based on a web cartoon, and perhaps if I could read Korean and had read
	that cartoon I might understand it a bit more. Set in the world of a fantasy game
	developer, a rich guy forces his way into the game company to save his younger
	otaku and cosplay fixated younger sister. It's quite watchable and inventive
	without being readily comprehensible to me.

	There's overt references to the "Choon Hyang" drama (which the Hong Sisters based their
	first drama on).

	Appropriately for a drama based on a web cartoon this was a web drama - judging
	by it they are very fast paced to the point of incoherence.
