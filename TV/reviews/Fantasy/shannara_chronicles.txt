	Three young adults in a fantasy world find themselves on a quest
	to stop a dark power returning to kill everyone. They have a
	varied series of cliffhanger adventures while working out their
	triangular relationships. That about is the plot.

	This isn't as epic as "Lord of The Rings". It's just simple digestible
	fantasy fun which motors along at a good pace. Not ponderous or
	pretentious. The fantasy world may not be as deeply fleshed out
	as Tolkein's, but neither is the fantasy world in Jackson's LOTR
	films which major on spectacle.

	This isn't as massive as "Game of Thrones". The number of characters
	to follow are far less. The tone is far different to the nihilist
	amorality of "Game of Thrones", where nastiness and anti-heroes are
	the draw. "Shannara Chronicles" is definitely heroic fantasy, where
	good with sacrifice will conquer evil, where characters can be
	redeemed or can be corrupted.

	This isn't quite the [http://terrybrooks.net/books/ Shannara Chronicles]
	as written by Terry Brooks. What we have is a collision between
	heroic fantasy and YA romance - for me a fun mixture but
	this is a personal view. It isn't the same tone as the books.
	Any more than Jackson captured Tolkein's tone.
