Text:
	A detective gets murdered but his soul ends up in a teddy bear. Which is
	won by a freeter girl trying to get over losing her boyfriend. Together
	they solve the case which got the detective murdered.

	Good acting by the heroine and the teddy bear.
	
	Just in case you were taking this seriously at the end it says
	this is all fiction.
