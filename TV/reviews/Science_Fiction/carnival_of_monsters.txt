Text:
	Plot: the Doctor finds himself trapped in an
	inter-galactic peepshow, where different life-forms
	are unwittingly caged in small worldlets.  He has to
	save himself and the other prisoners as the peepshow
	machine disintegrates.

	A neat mix of suspense, comedy (particularly the
	carnival characters), imaginative story-line and the
	social comment prevalent in the Jon Pertwee years.
	Perhaps some of the special effects are tacky . . .
	but this is classic fun.
