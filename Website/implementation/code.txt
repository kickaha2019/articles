Text:
	The "Code" declaration outputs a block of preformatted text.  Tabs will be indented
	two spaces, "&nbsp;"s are used to force the indentation in the HTML.  End of lines
	in the article text file will be newlines in the HTML.
	
	So:
	
Code:
	Code:
		if (a > b) {
			b = a
		}
		
Text:
	Comes out as:
	
Code:
	if (a > b) {
		b = a
	}

Text:
	For both the "Text" and "Code" declarations strange characters will be replaced by
	HTML entities or standard ASCII characters.  So "&" is replaced by "&amp;", and
	"<" is replaced by "&lt;" (if I've got that right.)
