	The "Left" declaration adds an image to the article page which is floated left in the RHS
	side of the article.
	
	Example:
	
Code:
	Left:
		/Users/peter/Sites/Articles/resources/logo_550.jpg
		
Text:
	Which gives:
	
Left:
	/Users/peter/Sites/Articles/resources/logo_550.jpg
	
Text:
	The dimensions of the image on the article page are controlled by parameters
	"FLOAT_HEIGHT" and "FLOAT_WIDTH".  The image is scaled to fit into these
	dimensions while preserving the aspect ratio.
