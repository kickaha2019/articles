Text:
	The ''Table'' declaration can be used to create a tabular section on
	an article page.  So for example:
	
Code:
	Table:
		Fruit|Colour
		Banana|Yellow
		Cherry|Red
	
Text:
	Comes out as:
	
Table:
	Fruit|Colour
	Banana|Yellow
	Cherry|Red
	
Text:
	Each row is a new line in the ''Table'' declaration.  The column values
	are separated by ''|''s.  
    
	The column values can contain links and bolded strings as in the ''Text''
	declaration.
