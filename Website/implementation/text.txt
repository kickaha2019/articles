Text:
	Most of the text on an article page will be in a "Text" 
	declaration.  The contents of a "Text" declaration are
	unformatted apart from blank lines will cause gaps in the
	article webpage itself.  So for example:
	
Code:
	Text:
		The
		first
		paragraph.
		
		The 
		second
		paragraph.
	
Text:
	Comes out as:
	
Code:
	The first paragraph.
		
	The second paragraph.
	
Text:
	Words can be bolded by surrounding them with pairs of
	apostrophes.  So:

Code:
	Normal text.  ''Bold text.''

Text:
	appears as "Normal text.  ''Bold text.''"

Text:
	"Text" declarations can contain links.  These are text elements
	delimited by square brackets.  The first kind of link is an explicit
	HTTP reference.  So example:
	
Code:
	[https://www.apple.com/ Apple] is a link to Apple's website.
	
Text:
	Comes out as:
	
	[https://www.apple.com/ Apple] is a link to Apple's website.
	
	The next kind of link is a link to another file in the website
	the articles are being generated into.  So for example:
	
Code:
	[/Users/peter/Sites/index.html index.html] is an absolute link to the website home page.
	
Text:
	Comes out as:
	
	[/Users/peter/Sites/index.html index.html] is a link to the website home page.
	
	The link can be relative.  So:
	
Code:
	[about Contact] is a link to the Contact article.
	
Text:
	Gives a link to the "Title" article:

	[about Contact] is a link to the Contact article.

	Lastly for repeated links to the same address the "http:" etc 
	element can be omitted and the article will reuse the last link.
	
	So:
	
Code:
	[Apple] goes to what "Apple" was linked to higher on the page.
	
Text:
	Which gives:
	
	[Apple] goes to what "Apple" was linked to higher on the page.
