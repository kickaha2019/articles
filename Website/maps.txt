	It's useful to display some information on a map. On my website
	for instance the places Virginia and I want to see are listed
	at [Holidays/wish_list_map Wish List Map]. Previously this was implemented
	using a free account with Google's Javascript API, but Google
	announced they would only support billable accounts in the
	future. Google are a business, it was kind of them to make this
	API available free for so long, but time for a change.
	Inspired by a [https://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/ page] I found
	surfing the web I decided to try another more primitive
	approach.

	Data sources

Text:
	To display maps you need base data for where cities or roads or
	coastlines and the like are. Happily there's a lot of free stuff
	out there. I'm currently using data from [http://www.naturalearthdata.com/ Natural Earth],
	[https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/ OpenDataNI], and
	[https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/opendata.html Ordnance Survey].
	Base data is available in a number of formats including [ESRI] shapefiles and
	[GeoJSON].

	Particularly to create test data [http://geojson.io/ geojson.io] is
	a useful site.

Heading:
	Transforming the base data

Text:
	There's a number of transformations which can be applied to the
	base data before displaying it on a map. The coordinate reference
	systems need to be changed to the one to use for display, otherwise
	things will be in the wrong place. It's useful to clip the data
	to the area to be displayed. It's also useful to simplify the data
	to the resolution needed, and to reduce the data if it contains
	items not be displayed.

	To achieve the coordinate transformations I used the
	[https://gdal.org/index.html GDAL toolkit], in
	particular the [https://gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html ogr2ogr] utility.
	I did try this for clipping and simplification, but for me
	it behaved oddly.

Heading:
	Generating SVG for display

Text:
	Still working on this. The idea is to convert [GeoJSON] into
	[SVG], and include that [SVG] into the webpages.
