Title:
	Responsive layout

Text:
	There were a number of reasons to overhaul the HTML / CSS. One was
	to make the webpages respond to different screen sizes - so where
	there were grids of pictures as in galleries make the grid only
	as wide as the screen. Also make the index of child pages bigger if
	possible to avoid wrapping of the links.

	Another reason was to make the HTML HTML5 compliant, and to routinely
	validate the pages (for the moment using [https://validator.w3.org/ W3C markup validation]).
	I make mistakes, and validating as far as possible is nice.

	I could have tried using something like [https://getbootstrap.com Bootstrap]
	to make the website responsive. I didn't want that much cleverness. My
	website is aimed to be low maintenance and simple. I prefer using as
	little technology as possible, using as few features to accomplish
	goals. The more features the more complicated a program is to
	maintain and understand, and the more vulnerable one is to changes.

	I did investigate using [http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-css3-flexbox-20120918/ flex layout].
	That's pretty neat, flexible - but not consistently implemented
	across browsers. Only more recent versions of Firefox handled wrapping
	of inline flex boses which was key to how I wanted to do the
	responsiveness.

	So instead I fell back onto using DIVs and inline flow layout which
	meant DIVs would wrap if there wasn't enough space. Together with CSS
	media queries to adjust sizes of the containing DIVs according to
	the screen acreage. This seems to work well, and is browser
	independent. A little bit finicky setting the margins and widths
	but doable.
