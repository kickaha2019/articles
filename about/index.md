This is the personal website of
Peter Rootham-Smith (Peter is fine.)  Welcome! That's not a picture of me
of course but instead our late beloved cat Tabitha. Much more photogenic than I am.

I drive a Kia, and my favourite colour is blue.
My interest include [TV](Links/TV),
[music](Music), [computer games](Games), [Go](Go),
and [software](Computing).

I'm married to Virginia who has made some [cakes](Cakes).
We like [eating out](Dining_out).  Virginia likes yoghurt and rhubarb,
I prefer peanut butter.  We have one cat Amelia, sadly we lost
Tabitha in [2018](2018/Tabitha).  We belong at
[Girton Baptist Church](http://www.girtonbaptistchurch.org.uk/).

There's a [diary](Diary) on this website of notable events,
assorted [links](Links), and how to [contact me](contact).

I like [books](Books). To look at a page in a book is like falling into a river -
a river which can bear one along for many a full stop and semi-colon.
By magic the letters and spaces become worlds and people which are as real
and familiar as the world containing what is read and the reader.

I like sampling the world's cuisine. Virginia and I dine out once a week
usually, often on a Friday as we both don't work that day. It ensures we get some quality
time together, and someone else does the cooking and washing up!

I like going to the cinema and seeing [films](Films).
This is still something magical to me - the lights go down,
the curtains draw apart, and another world appears.
