	This is the personal website of
	Peter Rootham-Smith (Peter is fine.)  Welcome! That's not a picture of me
  of course but instead our late beloved cat Tabitha. Much more photogenic than I am.

	I drive a Kia, and my favourite colour is blue.
	My interest include [../TV/index.html TV],
	[../Music/index.html music], [../Games/index.html computer games], [../Go/index.html Go],
	and [../Computing/index.html software].

	I'm married to Virginia who has made some [../Cakes/index.html cakes].
	We like [../Dining_out/index.html eating out].  Virginia likes yoghurt and rhubarb,
	I prefer peanut butter.  We have a couple of lovely
	cats, Tabitha and Amelia.  We belong at
	[Girton Baptist Church].

	There's a [../Diary/index.html diary] on this website of notable events,
	assorted [../Links/index.html links], and how to [../contact/index.html contact me].

	I like [../Books/index.html books]. To look at a page in a book is like falling into a river -
	a river which can bear one along for many a full stop and semi-colon.
	By magic the letters and spaces become worlds and people which are as real
	and familiar as the world containing what is read and the reader.

	I like sampling the world's cuisine. Virginia and I dine out once a week
	usually, often on a Friday as we both don't work that day. It ensures we get some quality
	time together, and someone else does the cooking and washing up!

	I like going to the cinema and seeing [../Films/index.html films].
	This is still something magical to me - the lights go down,
	the curtains draw apart, and another world appears.
