	This is the personal website of
	Peter Rootham-Smith (Peter is fine.)  Welcome! That's not a picture of me
  of course but instead our late beloved cat Tabitha. Much more photogenic than I am.

	I drive a Kia, and my favourite colour is blue.
	My interest include [TV TV],
	[Music music], [Games computer games], [Go Go],
	and [Computing software].

	I'm married to Virginia who has made some [Cakes cakes].
	We like [Dining_out eating out].  Virginia likes yoghurt and rhubarb,
	I prefer peanut butter.  We have a couple of lovely
	cats, Tabitha and Amelia.  We belong at
	[Girton Baptist Church].

	There's a [Diary diary] on this website of notable events,
	assorted [Links links], and how to [contact contact me].

	I like [Books books]. To look at a page in a book is like falling into a river -
	a river which can bear one along for many a full stop and semi-colon.
	By magic the letters and spaces become worlds and people which are as real
	and familiar as the world containing what is read and the reader.

	I like sampling the world's cuisine. Virginia and I dine out once a week
	usually, often on a Friday as we both don't work that day. It ensures we get some quality
	time together, and someone else does the cooking and washing up!

	I like going to the cinema and seeing [Films films].
	This is still something magical to me - the lights go down,
	the curtains draw apart, and another world appears.
