	I need the subtitles for a lot of films and TV that I watch. There's many
	people out there who for the love of it produce subtitles for TV shows and
	films, for instance the volunteers for [https://www.viki.com/ Viki] to name but one group. And I'm
	grateful to them.

	There are sites on the web where subtitles in various formats can be downloaded,
	but some the links on the subtitle websites go to places that well behaved
	browsers shouldn't go to. Places that will try to infect your computer by
	various means.

	I've become interested in the different subtitle file formats, and here
	is a list of the ones I've come into contact with:

Table:
	Name|Extension(s)|Format|Comments
	Advanced SubStation Alpha|.ass|Text|Widely used by fans who do subtitles
	Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange|.smi|Text|Microsoft format now happily rare
	PGS subtitle format|.sup|Binary|Subtitle format used on Blu-Ray movie
	SubRip Text|.srt|Text|Basic but very useful subtitle file format
  VobSub format|.idx/.sub|Text / Binary|Subtitle format used on DVD movies
