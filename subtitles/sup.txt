Title:
	PGS subtitle format

Text:
	A format used to hold bitmapped subtitles for films on Blu-Ray disks.
  After ripping
  a Blu-Ray film to disk using something like [makemkv], the subtitle track can be
  extracted to the Sup format using [mkvtoolnix].

	The format is described [http://forum.doom9.org/archive/index.php/t-172931.html here],
	and also [https://github.com/peterdk/SupRip/blob/master/Bluray%20Sup.txt here].

	It'll be nice to be able to convert Japanese subtitles in SUP format to be
	English subtitles in SRT format.  A possible approach is to first convert the
	SUP Japanese subtitles to be a set of PNG files for the subtitles, and a SRT file
	which has the filenames instead of the text. An experimental Java program to do
	this - SupExtract.

	Next step is to use OCR (optical character recognition) on those PNG images
	to convert them to Japanese text.
	[http://www.nuance.co.uk/for-business/by-product/omnipage/ultimate/index.htm Nuance Omnipage Ultimate]
	worked surprisingly well when I tried it on some sample files. But is a
	commercial product.

	So far so good. Let's say we now have a SRT file with names of .PNG files for the
	text, and a set of parallel named .TXT files containing the scanned OCR text.
	We can run each OCR text through [https://translate.google.co.uk Google Translate]
	using a script like srt_merge_txt.rb srt_merge_txt.rb. The hiccup is while Google Translate is
	free, and it does an amazing job, the subtitles are for something like Japanese
	rather chaotic.
